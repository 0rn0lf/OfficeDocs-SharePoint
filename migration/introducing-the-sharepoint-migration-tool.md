Designed to be used for migrations ranging from the smallest set of files to a large scale enterprise migration, the SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT) will let you bring your information to the cloud and take advantage of the latest collaboration, intelligence, and security solutions with Microsoft 365.

**SPMT** lets you migrate content to SharePoint Online and OneDrive from the following locations:

- SharePoint Server 2016 (Public Preview)
- SharePoint Server 2013
- SharePoint Foundation 2013
- SharePoint Server 2010
- SharePoint Foundation 2010
- Network and local file shares
  
## Download and install

## Planning and assessment

Planning is the key to a successful data migration.  The SharePoint Migration Assessment Tool (SMAT) is a simple command line executable that will scan the contents of your SharePoint Server 2013 farm to help identify any issues with data you plan to migrate to SharePoint Online. The results report points you to articles to help you fix any issues that were discovered. The tool runs in the background without impacting your production environment.
  
To download the tool: [SharePoint Migration Assessment Tool (SMAT)](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53598&amp;751be11f-ede8-5a0c-058c-2ee190a24fa6=True)
