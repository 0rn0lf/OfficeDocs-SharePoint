- **Step 2:** [Scan and assess](mm-box-step2-scan-assess.md) 
- **Step 3:** [Copy to Migrations list](mm-box-step3-copy-to-migrations.md)

## How do I get started?

To get started:

Go to the [Migration Manager page of the new SharePoint admin center](https://aka.ms/ODSP-MM-FS), and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) for your organization.

Make sure that you have:

- **Access to the destination**: You must either be a global admin or OneDrive/SharePoint admin to the Microsoft 365 tenant where you want to migrate your content. 

- **Access to the source**: Have Box account credentials that have read access to any Box user account you plan to migrate.

- **Prerequisites installed:** Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.
