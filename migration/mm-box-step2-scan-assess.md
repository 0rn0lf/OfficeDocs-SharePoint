# Step 2:  Scan and assess Box users

Box users are scanned automatically for you. Once the scans are complete, download the generated reports and logs to investigate any possible issues that might block your migration.

A table summary appears at the top to give you an at-a-glance overview of your users and content size.

1.  Review the scanned users. Select **Look for new users** if you want to manually search for additional users.

3. Once the scan is complete, select **Download scan log** from the menu bar, to troubleshoot any issues.

4. After you have determined a user is ready, and the scan status is complete, highlight the row, and then select **Copy to Migrations.**  Review the users listed, and then select **Copy to migrations**.
