Authorizing
Authorizing Google Cloud Storage is straightforward. To authorize or add a Google Cloud Storage account as a Connector, follow these simple steps:

From there, go to Storage and then Settings and Interoperability. From here, you can see your storage buckets, and which one is set to default.
Click on Create a new key. These are the credentials you'll use in the app in the next steps.
