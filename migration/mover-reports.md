# Reports

## Dashboard overview

The dashboard statistics given at the top of the **Migration Manager** provide a visual summary of your overall migration. This includes the number of users in the current selected migration, the number of files scanned or transfered, and the amount of data scanned or transfered; as well as any issues, errors, or failures that may have occured.

- **New**: Number of individual users that have yet to be scanned or transfered.
- **Running**: Number of users that are currently running either a scan or a transfer.
- **Complete**: Number of users that have successfully completed scans or transfers.
- **Issues**: Number of users that encountered errors during a scan or a transfer.

|**Filter label**|**Label effect**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Status|	Filters by status [for example, Failed, Success, User Does Not Exist, and so on.]|
|Files|	Filters based on files transfered, failed, and skipped.|
|Data	|Filters based on data that has transfered, failed, or skipped.|
|Success|	Displays all successful Data and Files transfered.|
|Failed	|Displays all Data and Files that have failed to transfer.|
|Skipped	|Displays all data and files that were skipped.|
|Schedule	|Displays all users with scheduled transfers [for example, Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly].|
|Path	|Filters for specific source or destination path [for example, path:username].|
|Destination|	Filters for specific destination path [for exaample, path:@domain<spam><spam>.com].|
|Source|	Filters for specific source path [for example, path:foldername].|
|Destination path	|Functions the same as **Destination**.|
|Source path	|Functions the same as **Source**.|
|Tags	 |Lists transfers with previously implemented custom tags.|
|Notes	|Filters by keywords in previously implemented custom notes.|
|Code|	Filters for specific status codes.|
|Destination name|	Displays transfers with a specific destination name.|

## Scan report

For more information about the scanning process, see the **Scanning** section.

After the scan report is downloaded and opened, look for these key items:

- Users with a failed status. We recommend rerunning the scan for these user(s).
- Users with one file or less. **Note**: Sharing permissions are still transfered.
- Users with the most data. Use this information to decide about a data distribution strategy that suits your needs. For more info about data distribution, see **here**.

## Migration report

|Average File Velocity (files/hour)|	Files transfered, divided by the total duration.|
|Average Data Velocity (MB/hour)	|Data (MB) transfered, divided by the total duration.|
|Last Status|	Last status of the user pairing.  This is also reflected by the color of each row in the **Migration Manager**. Examples include *Success*, *Some Problems*, *Failure*.|
