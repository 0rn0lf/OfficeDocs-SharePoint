1. From the [Migration page in the new SharePoint admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint?page=migrationCenter&modern), under **Box**, select **Get started**.
2. Select **Connect to Box**. 
3. Select **Authorize Mover**. Sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) for your organization.  This step uses your Microsoft credentials to connect Mover to your co-admin Box account.  Click **Next**.

5. Select the **Microsoft 365 migration app**.
6. On the left hand panel under Security, select **Permissions**.

8. On the Authenticate Box account screen, click **Authenticate account**. 
9. Sign in to grant access to Box. Select **Authorize** and then **Grant access to Box**.
10. You're now connected to Box. Click **Finish** to close the window.
