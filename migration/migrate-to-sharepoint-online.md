# Migrate your content to Microsoft 365

Moving to Microsoft 365? Let us help you migrate your content easily and securely.

>[!Note]
>When you migrate your content to Microsoft 365, you are copying the files.  Your source files are not deleted.


## Migrate File Shares
Migrating your file shares with Migration Manager lets you have a centralized way of connecting servers, creating tasks, and automatically load balancing your migration tasks. You're guided through the steps of migrating your file shares, from the setup of agents, the creation of tasks, and the final migration to Microsoft 365. You can specify global or task level settings, view all-up task progress, and download aggregated summary and task level reports.

- **Azure Data Box**. Want to remove the dependency on your WAN link to transfer data?  The Microsoft Azure Data Box is a service that lets you order a device from the Microsoft Azure portal. You can then copy TBs of data from your servers to the device, ship it back to Microsoft, and your data is copied into Azure. Once your data is in Azure, use SPMT to migrate content to SharePoint.

- **OneDrive sync app**  Are you an individual user wanting to move files from your on-premises environment to OneDrive or SharePoint?  After installing the OneDrive sync app and syncing your library, you can drag and drop files to a folder on the computer and the content will automatically sync with either OneDrive or SharePoint.
