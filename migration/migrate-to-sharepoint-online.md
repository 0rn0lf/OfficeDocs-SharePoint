# Migrate to SharePoint Online and OneDrive

Moving to SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business?
  
There are different options available to migrate content to SharePoint Online, depending on the size and quantity of files you need to move. 
  
## What is SharePoint Online?

A component of your Office 365 enterprise subscription, SharePoint Online (SPO) is a cloud based collaboration platform that lets you and your organization store, organize, and share data and easily communicate with each other. With SPO, you can share common resources and applications on portals, search to discover information and expertise across your organization, and stay in the know with personalized news in SharePoint home and the SharePoint mobile apps.
  
## Planning your move to SharePoint online

The method you select to move your data depends on a number of factors including the amount of data and the size. What data do you want or need to move? Where is the content currently stored? Taking the time to plan your migration, including taking an inventory and assessment of your data, is key to a successful migration.

## Assess your data ##

  Use the SharePoint Assessment and Identity Management tool for SharePoint 2013 and 2010 servers to assist in migration to SharePoint online.
