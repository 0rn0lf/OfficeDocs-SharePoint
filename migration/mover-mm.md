# Migration Manager overview

The **Migration Manager** is the key part of our app. It is the primary screen for interacting during the data migration process.

## Migration Manager dashboard

Use the **Migration Manager** dashboard for a summary of your overall migration. This is covered in depth **here**.

## Main menu bar

Use our app's main navigation bar to switch between the **Migration Manager**, **Transfer Wizard**, and your **Account** details, as well as contact support if you run into any issues during your migration.

## Migration selection

Use the **Migration Selection** bar to navigate between separate multi-user migrations, as well as individual normal transfers.

Here, you are also able to edit and personalize the names of each multi-user migration.

## Filters

Use the **Active Filters** bar to search your migration for specific key terms or custom tags you have applied.

You can also view more in-depth instructions by selecting the info button directly to the right of the **Active Filters** search bar, or by viewing the **Active Filter** list.

## User display

The user display is the central focus of the **Migration Manager**, and displays all the users in the current migration.

This section of our app provides you with a column-by-column breakdown of each individual user in a migration. Here, you can also duplicate and edit source/destination paths of a user, as well as view the logs of any scanned or completed transfers.

## User actions and finalization

This area of the screen contains the **User Actions** dropdown menu, the **Scan User** and **Start Migrating Users** buttons.

**User Actions** opens a new dropdown menu enabling you to interact with a selected transfer.

**Scan # Users** performs a scan of the selected users. This helps identify any problematic files, folders, or connectors.

**Start # Migrating Users** opens a side tab enabling you to finalize and begin the migration.
