# Allow notifications

Notifications about file activity in OneDrive and SharePoint can be shown to users across the apps and devices they use. For example, notifications can be sent through the Firebase Cloud Messaging or Apple Push Notification service to the Office mobile app for Android or iOS. They can be sent through the OneDrive sync app to PC or Mac. This setting lets you turn off these notifications for all users for compliance purposes. If you allow these notifications, users can select to turn them off app by app where they donâ€™t want them. 
  
## Turn on external sharing notifications

1. Sign in to the [OneDrive admin center](https://admin.onedrive.com) as a global or SharePoint admin, and select **Notifications** in the left pane.

2. Under **Email OneDrive owners when**, make sure the following check boxes are selected: 
    
  - **Other users invite additional users to shared files**
    
  - **External users accept invitations to access files**
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > This setting no longer works for the new sharing experience that appears in most places. This setting will be removed.
