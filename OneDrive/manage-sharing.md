# Manage sharing in OneDrive and SharePoint

As a [global admin or SharePoint admin](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role), you can control how sharing works at the organization level in OneDrive and SharePoint. Because each OneDrive is a site (previously called "site collection") within SharePoint, your organization's SharePoint settings and OneDrive settings are related.

## Manage sharing in the new SharePoint admin center

To manage your sharing settings, use the [**Sharing page** of the new SharePoint admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint?page=sharing&modern=true), instead of the **Sharing page** in the OneDrive admin center. It lets you manage all the settings and latest features in one place.

To learn more, see [Manage sharing settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off).

> [!NOTE]
> Some sharing settings exist in multiple admin centers. For example, the SharePoint setting on the [**Settings page** in the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/SettingsMultiPivot) is the same as the SharePoint external sharing setting in the OneDrive admin center and the new SharePoint admin center. When you change sharing settings, make sure you communicate the changes with any other admins in your organization. 

> [!Note]
> If you have Office 365 Germany, [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=848041), then browse to the SharePoint admin center and open the **Sharing page**. <br>If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850627), then browse to the SharePoint admin center and open the **Sharing page**.
