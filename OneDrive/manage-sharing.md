# Manage sharing in OneDrive and SharePoint

As a global admin or SharePoint admin in Office 365, you can control how sharing works at the organization level in OneDrive and SharePoint. Because each OneDrive is a site (previously called "site collection") within SharePoint, your organization's SharePoint settings and OneDrive settings are related.
  
To learn how to change the external sharing setting of an individual user's OneDrive, see [Change the external sharing setting for a user's OneDrive](user-external-sharing-settings.md). For info about how to share a file or folder in OneDrive, see [Share OneDrive files and folders](https://support.office.com/article/9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07#BKMK_BusinessTab).

## Manage sharing in the new SharePoint admin center

Instead of using the Sharing page in the OneDrive admin center to manage your sharing settings, we recommend using the Sharing page in the new SharePoint admin center. It lets you manage all the settings and all the latest features in one place.

1. Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com as a global or SharePoint admin. (If you see a message that you don't have permission to access the page, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions in your organization.)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have Office 365 Germany, sign in at https://portal.office.de. If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), sign in at https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn/. Then select the Admin tile to open the admin center.  

2. In the left pane, under **Admin centers**, select **SharePoint**. (You might need to select **Show all** to see the list of admin centers.)

3. If the classic SharePoint admin center appears, select **Open it now** at the top of the page to open the new SharePoint admin center.

4. In the left pane of the new SharePoint admin center, under **Policies**, select **Sharing**.

For information about setting up sharing for your organization, see:

- [Collaborate with guests on a document](https://docs.microsoft.com/Office365/Enterprise/collaborate-on-documents)
- [Collaborate with guests in a site](https://docs.microsoft.com/Office365/Enterprise/collaborate-in-a-site)
- [Collaborate with guests in a team](https://docs.microsoft.com/Office365/Enterprise/collaborate-as-a-team)
  
> [!NOTE]
> Some sharing settings exist in multiple admin centers. When you change them in one place, the other admin centers will reflect the change. If you have multiple admins in your organization, make sure you communicate the changes you're making. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, under **Settings** \> **Services &amp; add-ins** \> **Sites**, the External sharing setting is the same as the SharePoint external sharing setting in the OneDrive admin center and the new SharePoint admin center.
