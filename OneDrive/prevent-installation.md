# Prevent users from installing the OneDrive sync app

The Sync button helps users install and set up the new OneDrive sync app. If you want to manage the rollout of the sync app to your organization, you can hide the Sync button on the OneDrive website to prevent your users from downloading the sync app themselves.
  
 **To prevent users from downloading the OneDrive sync app**
  
1. Open the [OneDrive admin center](https://admin.onedrive.com/?v=SyncSettings), and click **Sync** in the left pane.

3. Click **Save**.
