# Learn about the OneDrive guided tour

OneDrive helps Office 365 business and education subscribers around the world get their work done, and we want to make sure you get the most out of OneDrive. So, we've introduced this five-step guided tour to help you get set up.
  
##

The online tutorial contains five steps that you can complete any time.
  
1. Sign in (It's already done the first time you see it. That's progress, right?)
    
2. Upload a file
    
3. Get the OneDrive mobile app, available in the app store for Android, iOS, or Windows Phone
    
4. Get the OneDrive desktop sync app
    
5. Share a file with others
    
The guided tour appears only for users who are new to OneDrive for Business on the web. To close the tour, click the X in the top corner.
