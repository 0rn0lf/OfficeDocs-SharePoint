# Allow syncing only on computers joined to specific domains

To make sure that users sync OneDrive files only on managed computers, you can configure OneDrive to sync only on PCs that are joined to specific domains.
  
 **To allow syncing only on PCs joined to specific domains**
  
1. Open the [OneDrive admin center](https://admin.onedrive.com/?v=SyncSettings) and click **Sync** in the left pane.

2. Select the **Allow syncing only on PCs joined to specific domains** check box. 
    
3. Click **Add domains**.
    
4. Add the [GUID of each domain](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=871987) where you want to allow users to sync files. 
    
5. If you want to prevent Mac OS users from syncing entirely, select the **Block sync on Mac OS** check box. 
    
6. Click **Save** on the Sync page.
