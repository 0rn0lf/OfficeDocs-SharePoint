# Understanding workflow in SharePoint Server 2016
 **We are in the process of combining the SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of SharePoint an article applies to.** * **Applies to:** SharePoint Server 2016*  * **Topic Last Modified:** 2016-09-16* **Summary:** Learn about the components and concepts in SharePoint Server 2016 workflow.Processes are central to any organization and workflow is the orchestrator of processes. SharePoint Server 2016 builds stability and reliability into the proven workflow platforms available to SharePoint Server. The naming of these platforms can seem confusing at first. You can think of the 2010 platform as the traditional workflow platform that installs with SharePoint and you can think of the 2013 platform as the scaled platform that is made available through a separate product called Workflow Manager.

## 2010 Workflow Platform

The 2010 platform is built into SharePoint and installs when you install SharePoint Server 2016. This embedded workflow engine was the only workflow option available to SharePoint Server in the 2010 release and the name stuck with all subsequent releases of SharePoint even though the embedded workflow engine has continued to increase stability.
## 2013 Workflow Platform

SharePoint Server 2016 can use the workflow service built on Windows Workflow Foundation. This service is called Workflow Manager and it is designed to play a central role in the enterprise. The 2013 platform is designed to scale and increase performance for large amounts of workflow activity. The platform was first introduced in SharePoint Server 2013 and maintains the name even though SharePoint Server 2016 introduced added stability and performance. The 2013 platform is available when you install the Workflow Manager product and configure it to work with the SharePoint Server 2016 farm.
