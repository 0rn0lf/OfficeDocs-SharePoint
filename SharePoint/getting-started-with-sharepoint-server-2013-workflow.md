# Getting started with SharePoint Server 2013 workflow
 **We are in the process of combining the SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of SharePoint an article applies to.** * **Applies to:** SharePoint Server 2013*  * **Topic Last Modified:** 2017-07-24* **Summary:** Learn about the two workflow platforms available in SharePoint Server 2013 and the tools for working with them.SharePoint Server 2013 brings several changes to workflow. This guide gets you started with workflow in SharePoint Server 2013. SharePoint Server 2013 can use the workflow service built on the Windows Workflow Foundation. This service is called Workflow Manager and it is designed to play a central role in the enterprise. Processes are central to any organization and workflow is the orchestrator of processes. Workflow Manager integration was introduced with SharePoint Server 2013. SharePoint Server 2016 builds stability and reliability into this already proven workflow platform. The Workflow Manager platform continues to be called the SharePoint 2013 Workflow Platform and the traditional workflow platform continues to be called the SharePoint 2010 Workflow platform.
## Workflow development tools

There are several tools that come together to provide a rich workflow development experience. These include the following:
- SharePoint Designer 2013
    
  
- Visual Studio 2015
    
  
- A supported web browser such as Edge, Firefox, or Chrome
    
  
 **SharePoint Designer 2013**    The primary development tool for a SharePoint Server 2013 workflow is called SharePoint Designer 2013. SharePoint Designer 2013 provides a rich set of features specifically designed for workflow development against both the SharePoint 2010 Workflow platform and the SharePoint 2013 Workflow platform. You work with SharePoint Designer 2013 by opening it on your local computer and then connecting it to a SharePoint Server 2013 site.

 **Visual Studio 2015**Visual Studio 2015 is used in many types of Microsoft development. You can use Visual Studio 2015 to develop workflows similar to SharePoint Designer 2013. However it can also be used to develop custom actions and tasks such as a workflow action that interacts with a custom application. SharePoint Server 2013 ships with a rich assortment of actions and tasks. If you need a very specific action, you can use Visual Studio 2015 to develop it. The custom action can then be used in SharePoint Designer 2013 by a workflow developer. **Web browser**    A web browser, such as Edge, Firefox, or Chrome, is what you use to interact with SharePoint Server 2013 sites. For example, you can create lists and libraries, associate a workflow with a list and library, add items to a list or library, start a workflow on an item, and check the status of a workflow.
