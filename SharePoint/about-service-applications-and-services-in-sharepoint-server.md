# About service applications and services in SharePoint Server
 **We are in the process of combining the SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of SharePoint an article applies to.** * **Applies to:** SharePoint Foundation 2013, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016*  * **Topic Last Modified:** 2017-07-24* **Summary:** Learn about service applications and service application connections in SharePoint Server 2016 and SharePoint Server 2013.In SharePoint Server, individual services can be configured independently and third-party companies can add services. The services infrastructure gives you control over which services are deployed and how services are shared. Services that are deployed are named  *service applications*  . A service application provides a resource that can be shared across sites throughout a farm, and can be accessed by users through a hosting web application. Service applications are associated to web applications by *service application connections*  . Some services can be shared across farms.For more information about how to manage service applications that included instructions for publishing service applications across farms, see  [Manage service applications in SharePoint Server](html/manage-service-applications-in-sharepoint-server.md) and [Share service applications across farms in SharePoint Server](html/share-service-applications-across-farms-in-sharepoint-server.md).For more information about starting, stopping, and configuring services, see  [Start or stop a service in SharePoint Server](html/start-or-stop-a-service-in-sharepoint-server.md).For details about the SharePoint Server 2016 service applications associated with each MinRole server role, see  [Description of MinRole and associated services in SharePoint Server 2016](html/description-of-minrole-and-associated-services-in-sharepoint-server-2016.md).
