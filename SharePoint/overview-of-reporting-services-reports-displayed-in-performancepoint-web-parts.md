# Overview of Reporting Services reports displayed in PerformancePoint Web Parts
 **We are in the process of combining the SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of SharePoint an article applies to.** * **Applies to:** SharePoint Server 2016*  * **Topic Last Modified:** 2016-09-16* **Summary:** Learn about how to include Reporting Services reports in a PerformancePoint web part.SQL Server Reporting Services reports are reports that are published to Reporting Services. Reporting Services reports can resemble tables or charts, and they can include their own filters, which are also known as parameters. Reporting Services reports are typically highly interactive. Depending on how the reports are configured, dashboard users can explore data by clicking, sorting, and scrolling through pages. In addition, users can perform the following kinds of tasks:
- Preview, adjust, and print one or more pages in the report. 
    
  
- Apply one or more parameters without having to rerun a query to the database. Parameters are built-in filters that are specific to the report. 
    
  
- Export data as image files, Adobe PDF files, Web files, or other formats that Microsoft applications recognize. 
    
  
When you use Dashboard Designer to include Reporting Services reports in your dashboard, you do not actually create the reports. Instead, you create PerformancePoint Web Parts to display Reporting Services reports and receive dashboard filters.
