# Overview of PerformancePoint strategy maps
 **We are in the process of combining the SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of SharePoint an article applies to.** * **Applies to:** SharePoint Server 2016*  * **Topic Last Modified:** 2016-09-16* **Summary:** Learn about strategy maps in PerformancePoint Dashboard Designer.A strategy map is a report view that can show relationships between objectives, goals, and key performance indicators (KPIs). In a PerformancePoint dashboard, a strategy map alongside its scorecard might resemble the following image:

 In the image, the color of each shape in the diagram is determined by the indicator that is connected to it. For example, the scorecard shows that Asia is on target overall, off target for the Sales Amount measure, and on target for the Sales Quantity measure. Thus, we see the shape that represents Asia colored in green, the shape for Sales Amounts colored in yellow, and Sales Quantity colored in green. You are not limited to simple diagrams such as the one shown. You can use any Visio diagram. However, if you want the shape colors to update automatically, the kinds of shapes that you use matter. To configure the strategy map so that the shape colors correspond to scorecard values, use a Visio diagram that does not consist of complex shapes. Examples of complex shapes include shapes that consist of groups or sets of other shapes. 
## Strategy maps and the Balanced Scorecard in PerformancePoint Services

Strategy maps have their roots in the Balanced Scorecard framework, which defines organizational performance by using four perspectives:
- **Financial**    This perspective typically includes metrics such as revenue, cost, and profit.
    
  
- **Customer**    This perspective, which is also known as the customer satisfaction perspective, typically includes metrics such as customer counts, market share, and number of complaints.
    
  
- **Internal process**    This perspective, which is also known as the operations perspective, typically includes metrics such as time to market for new products, service error rates, and quality control measures.
    
  
- **Learning and growth**    This perspective, which is also known as the human resources perspective, typically includes metrics such as employee turnover rates, the number of new employees, and hiring data.
    
  
A Balanced Scorecard in PerformancePoint Services is typically a dashboard page that consists of the following:
- A scorecard that displays performance metrics across the organization using the four perspectives described earlier in this section. The scorecard contains four groups of KPIs that correspond to those perspectives. For example, one set of KPIs includes financial metrics, another set includes customer metrics, and so on.
    
  
- A strategy map that includes four groups of shapes (one group of shapes for each perspective) that are connected to the scorecard KPIs. 
    
  
A Balanced Scorecard might resemble the following image:

 Although many organizations find the Balanced Scorecard framework useful, you do not have to follow it when you create your strategy map. You can create your strategy map using any combination of KPIs and objectives in a PerformancePoint scorecard. For example, you can use a strategy map to show performance metrics across different geographical regions. Or, you can diagram a process in your organization and show how well each contributor to the process is performing.
