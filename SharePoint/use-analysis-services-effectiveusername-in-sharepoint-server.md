# Use Analysis Services EffectiveUserName in SharePoint Server
 **We are in the process of combining the SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of SharePoint an article applies to.** * **Applies to:** SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016*  * **Topic Last Modified:** 2017-07-07* **Summary:** Use the EffectiveUserName option in Excel Services or PerformancePoint Services for per-user authentication with Analysis Services data sources. *EffectiveUserName*  is a SQL Server Analysis Services connection string property that contains the name of the user who is accessing a report or dashboard. In SharePoint Server, you can use this property in conjunction with Excel Services or PerformancePoint Services to pass the identity of the user who is viewing the report or dashboard to SQL Server Analysis Services. This allows per-user identity without the need to configure Kerberos delegation.
