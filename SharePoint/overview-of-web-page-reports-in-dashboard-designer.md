# Overview of Web Page reports in Dashboard Designer
 **We are in the process of combining the SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of SharePoint an article applies to.** * **Applies to:** SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016*  * **Topic Last Modified:** 2016-09-16* **Summary:** Learn about web page reports in PerformancePoint Dashboard Designer.In PerformancePoint Dashboard Designer, a Web Page report is a report type that you can use to display a Web site in a dashboard. You would typically use Web Page reports for purposes such as the following:
- To add textual details about other reports on the dashboard page. For example, you might use a Web Page report to help users understand the key performance indicators (KPIs) that are in a scorecard and what actions they should take when a KPI is off target.
    
  
- To add a Web site, such as a financial news page that displays alerts, stock market activity, and news bulletins to a dashboard targeted at sales, marketing, or finance professionals. 
    
  
- To display a report, such as a Visio Graphics Service report, an Access Services report, or a Project Server report that you cannot create by using Dashboard Designer.
    
  
- To add a blog or a forum that displays discussion threads and user comments on a new product in a dashboard page. 
    
  
A Web Page report displays an internal or external site in a Web Part that you can then include in your dashboard, either as a single item on the page or as an item alongside other dashboard items. 
## Limitations of PerformancePoint Services Web Page reports

The site that you display in a Web Page report is live and fully functional, exactly as it is in a typical Web browser. However, Web Page reports do not typically have filtering and exporting capabilities that are available in other PerformancePoint report types. 
- **Dashboard filters**    In general, you cannot connect a dashboard filter to a Web Page report. However, depending on the site that is displayed in the Web Page report, you might be able to add a parameter to the Web site address (URL) that is specified for the report.
    
  
- **Exporting information**    Dashboard users cannot export a Web Page report to PowerPoint or Excel by using the Web Part menu for a Web Page report. To capture the information displayed in a Web Page report, dashboard users can print the report by using the Print toolbar commands for the Web browser.
