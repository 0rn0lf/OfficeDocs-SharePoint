It uses search results from the Search Results Web Part so that when users click a search vertical link, the search results are filtered and displayed following the configuration of the search vertical. You can also create your own search vertical and add it to be displayed in the Search Navigation Web Part.By changing properties on the Search Navigation Web Part you can do the following:
- Specify a different Web Part from which search results are received.
    
  
- Change the number of search vertical links to display.
