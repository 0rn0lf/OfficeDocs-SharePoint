 **We are in the process of combining the SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of SharePoint an article applies to.** * **Applies to:** Office 365 Enterprise, SharePoint Online, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016*  * **Topic Last Modified:** 2017-06-20* **Summary:** Learn about SharePoint Server hybrid environments and the hybrid solutions available for SharePoint Server and SharePoint Online.With SharePoint Server hybrid, productivity services in SharePoint Online can be integrated with on-premises SharePoint Server to provide unified functionality and access to data. For enterprises that want to gradually move their existing on-premises SharePoint Server services to the cloud, SharePoint Server hybrid provides a staged migration path by extending high-impact SharePoint Server workloads to SharePoint Online.A SharePoint Server hybrid environment enables trusted communications between SharePoint Online and SharePoint Server. When you have established this trust framework, you can configure integrated functionality between services and features such as Search, Follow, and user profiles.To get started exploring hybrid, see the following articles:
