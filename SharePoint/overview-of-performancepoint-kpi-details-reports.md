A KPI Details report is a view type that provides additional information about scorecard values and properties. As dashboard users click cells in a scorecard, the KPI Details report updates to display particular information about that value. For example, when dashboard users click a value in the Target column, the KPI Details report displays details such as how performance is calculated, what banding settings are used, and what kind of indicator is used. To display information, a KPI Details report must be connected to a scorecard in the dashboard. This means that a KPI Details report is not used in a dashboard without its accompanying scorecard on the same dashboard page. However, you can create and configure a KPI Details report one time, and then reuse it in multiple dashboards, connected to multiple scorecards.
