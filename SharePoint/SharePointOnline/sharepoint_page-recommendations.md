# Page recommendations
SharePoint recommendations on modern pages help you and your users discover pages and news in your organization. At the bottom of news posts and pages, you'll see recommendations especially for you or your users. Recommendations show below the heading **You may also be interested in**.

Recommendations are shown on all newly-created pages and news posts by default.

## How are recommendations determined for each user?
Generally, recommendations are based on what other people have read next; what is popular with your colleagues; and what is popular on your site. Only pages and posts that users have access to are shown.
Here is a diagram that shows how recommendations are determined in more detail:

## How to disable recommendations
Page authors can turn off recommendations for the pages they create, and users can hide individual recommendations. Site owners can disable them at the site level. They cannot be turned off for an entire tenant. To learn how to disable at the page and site level, see [SharePoint page recommendations](https://support.office.com/article/sharepoint-page-recommendations-12bf4c4e-3452-4575-afd4-ef7536b027fa/).
