# How SharePoint page recommendations work
SharePoint recommendations on modern pages help you and your users discover pages and news in your organization. At the bottom of news posts and pages, you'll see recommendations especially for you or your users. Recommendations show below the heading **You may also be interested in**.

Recommendations are shown on all newly-created pages and news posts by default.

## How are recommendations determined for each user?
The recommendations that users see on their pages are based on what their colleagues have read next; what is popular with their colleagues; and what is popular on the site. Only pages and posts that users have access to are shown.

Here is a diagram that shows how recommendations are determined in more detail:

## How to disable recommendations
To learn how to disable at the page and site level, see [SharePoint page recommendations](https://support.office.com/article/sharepoint-page-recommendations-12bf4c4e-3452-4575-afd4-ef7536b027fa/).

In the article linked above, you'll learn the three different ways to hide or disable recommendations:

-   Users can hide individual recommendations  

-   Page authors can turn off recommendations for the pages they create

-   Site owners can disable recommendations at the site level

> [!NOTE]
> Recommendations can't be disabled for an entire tenant.
