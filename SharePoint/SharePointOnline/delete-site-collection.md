# Delete a site collection

When you, as a global or SharePoint admin in Office 365, delete a site collection, it's moved to the site collection Recycle Bin and retained for 93 days. Deleting the site collection deletes everything within it, including:
  
- Document libraries and files.
    
- Lists and list data.
    
- Site settings and history.
    
- Any subsites and their contents.
    
You should notify the site collection owners and subsite owners before you delete a site collection so they can move their data to another location, and also tell users when the sites will be deleted. 

> [!TIP] 
> To delete a communication site or a team site that uses one of the new templates, use the new SharePoint admin center preview. For info, see [Manage sites in the new SharePoint admin center](manage-sites-in-new-admin-center.md).

1. Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com as a global or SharePoint admin. (If you see a message that you don't have permission to access the page, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions in your organization.)
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have Office 365 Germany, sign in at https://portal.office.de. If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), sign in at https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn/. Then select the Admin tile to open the admin center.  
    
2. In the left pane, select **Admin centers** \> **SharePoint**. If this opens the new SharePoint admin center, select **Classic SharePoint admin center** in the left pane.
    
3. Select the check box next to the site collection or multiple site collections that you want to delete.
    
4. On the **Site Collections** tab, select **Delete**.
