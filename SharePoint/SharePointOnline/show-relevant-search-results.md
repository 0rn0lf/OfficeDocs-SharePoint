# Show the right search results

All search results are not relevant to everyone all the time. Learn how you can help users find exactly the results they're looking for in SharePoint Online. 
  
 **Manage the search schema**
  
The search schema controls what you can search for, how you can search it, and how the results get presented on your search websites. In the search schema, you can view, create, or change managed properties, and map crawled properties to managed properties. [Manage the search schema in SharePoint Online](https://support.office.com/article/d4fab46d-ba41-4c03-9d4c-32b5b33198b6).
  
 **Manage query rules**
  
Query rules consist of conditions and associated actions. When a query meets the conditions in a query rule, the search system performs the actions specified in the rule. [Manage query rules](https://support.office.com/article/53556bb4-3625-490b-aa89-1223e3d4ce3f).
  
 **Manage query suggestions**
  
Query spelling suggestions are words that appear below the search box as a user types a query. SharePoint automatically creates a query suggestion when you've clicked a search result for a query at least six times. You can also import your own lists of query suggestions to SharePoint. [Customize query suggestions in SharePoint search](https://support.office.com/article/9ef0f859-3b92-41e9-b393-cb43d6094c7b).
  
 **Using query transforms**
  
You can configure a query transform to replace properties of a query, such as the result source that the query will use to get search results, or the sort order that it will use when it displays search results. [Understanding query transforms](https://support.office.com/article/b31631a5-0c1f-436e-8061-fd807bb96ae1).
  
 **Manage result sources**
  
Result sources limit searches to certain content, or to a subset of search results. You can also use result sources to send queries to external providers such as Bing. [Manage result sources](https://support.office.com/article/fd8d6ac6-c5d0-454d-80a9-51580902b25d).
  
 **Manage result types**
  
A result type specifies one or more conditions to compare search results against, and an action to take if a search result meets those conditions. The action specifies the display template to use for the search result. [Manage result types](https://support.office.com/article/ceccf561-e82c-495c-bf3e-b3f006ae9c8c).
  
 **Manage search dictionaries**
  
You can use search dictionaries to include or exclude words for query spelling correction, and you can include or exclude company names to be extracted from the content of indexed documents. [Learn more](manage-search-dictionaries.md).
  
 **Manage authoritative pages**
  
You can influence the pages or documents that should appear at the top of your list of search results by identifying authoritative pages - high-quality pages that link to the most relevant information. [Manage authoritative pages](https://support.office.com/article/68429de6-7c7b-455c-a90a-2afaa3444647).
  
 **Create a custom ranking model**
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Creating a custom ranking model is a complicated process. Only expert users should create custom ranking models. 
  
In most cases, the ranking models in SharePoint Online provide good search result ranking, and you can also influence the ranking of search results with query rules. If you have a relevance need that the standard ranking models don't provide, you can create a custom ranking model. [Create a custom ranking model by using the Ranking Model Tuning App](https://support.office.com/article/345be622-2f63-450c-bd65-869ce830b7c1).
  
 **Export and import search settings**
  
You can export and import customized search configuration settings between tenants, site collections, and sites. The settings include all customized query rules, result sources, result types, ranking models and site search settings.
