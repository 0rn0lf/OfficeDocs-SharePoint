# Overview of the SharePoint Success Site 

The SharePoint Success Site is a ready to deploy and customizable SharePoint communication site that helps your organization maximize the adoption of SharePoint. The SharePoint Success Site is designed to support new SharePoint site owners in creating high-impact sites to meet the goals of your organization.

The SharePoint Success Site builds on the power of [Microsoft 365 learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/) which allows you to use Microsoft-maintained playlists or to create custom playlists to meet the unique needs of your organization. If you are already using M365 learning pathways and don't want to provision the site, you can upload the [SharePoint Success Site playlist into learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/SharePoint/add-sss-cdn).

Install the SharePoint Success Site in your tenant environment, customize the pre-populated training content, and make it available to end users.

#### Microsoft 365 learning pathways
When you provision the SharePoint Success Site, you will first be required to install [Microsoft 365 learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/). M365 learning pathways connects to a Microsoft-maintained content repository that includes publicly available SharePoint help content. As the content repository is updated, M365 learning pathways will automatically display updated SharePoint content.
