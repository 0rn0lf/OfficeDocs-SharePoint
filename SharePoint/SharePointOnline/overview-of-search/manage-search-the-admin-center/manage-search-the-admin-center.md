# SharePoint Online search administration overview

As a SharePoint Online administrator, you can customize the search experience for users. This customization includes defining searchable managed properties in the search schema, identifying high-quality pages to improve relevance, managing query rules and result sources, and removing individual results. You can also evaluate any changes by viewing reports about usage and search.
  
The changes you make from the search administration page are valid for the whole tenant, but you can also customize search on site collection level and on site level.
