# Search Center settings

As a SharePoint Online administrator, you can specify where searches should go by specifying the URL of your Search Center. For example, if you have created an Enterprise Search Center where users can search everything in your company, you can enter the URL of that site here. 
  
## Enter the address of your Search Center
<a name="__goback"> </a>

2. Choose **Admin** > **SharePoint**. You're now in the SharePoint admin center.
    
3. Choose **search**. 
    
4. On the search administration page, choose **Search Center Settings**.
    
5. In the **Search Center URL** box, type the URL of the Search Center site. 
  
Example: http://companyportal/searchcenter/pages.
