# View search usage reports

If you're a SharePoint admin in your organization, you're probably asked questions about search usage, such as:
  
- What are the top queries on my site per day or per month?
    
- How many search queries are users performing on average?
    
- Which queries are getting low clicks as they're simply not showing up in any results?
    
- How often are query rules firing and how often are people clicking promoted results?
    
This article describes how you can use search reports in the SharePoint admin center to find answers to these questions.
