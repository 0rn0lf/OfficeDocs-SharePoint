# Get started with the new SharePoint admin center

As a global or SharePoint admin in Office 365, you can try the new SharePoint admin center (preview). To access it, go to the current SharePoint admin center and click **Try the preview** in the upper right.

> [!NOTE]
> Some functionality is introduced gradually to organizations that have opted in to the [Set up the Standard or Targeted release options in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/3b3adfa4-1777-4ff0-b606-fb8732101f47). This means that you may not yet see this feature or it may look different than what is described in the help articles. 
  
## Schedule for releasing the new SharePoint admin center

The new SharePoint admin center (preview) is now available worldwide to customers who have selected the standard release option. The classic SharePoint admin center will continue to be the default for several months. You'll need to switch back to it to perform some tasks. You'll be able to continue using the classic SharePoint admin center for several months before we begin retiring it.
  
To switch back to the classic SharePoint admin center:
  
- In the lower left of the new SharePoint admin center, click **Go to the classic SharePoint admin center**.
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a setting exists in both the new and classic SharePoint admin centers, and possibly other admin centers such as the OneDrive and Office 365 admin centers, when you change it in one place, the other admin centers will reflect the change. If you have multiple admins in your organization, make sure you communicate the changes you're making.

## View reports

On the Home page, you can see at a glance:
  
- The number of files that have specific types of activity each day for the past 30 days. (If an activity occurs multiple times in one day on the same file, the file is counted only once for that day.)
    
- The number of total and active sites each day for the past 30 days. ("Active" sites are any where users view a page or view, modify, upload, download, share, or sync a file.)

> [!TIP]
>  To filter a report, click an item in the legend. For example, on the Files by activity type chart, click "Viewed or edited." >  To see values for a specific day, point to that day on the report. >  To see more details about a report, click **Details** to open the report in the Office 365 admin center. Here, you can see tables of activity by site or users, change the reporting period, pivot the report, export the report data into a .csv file that you can open in Excel, and more.
