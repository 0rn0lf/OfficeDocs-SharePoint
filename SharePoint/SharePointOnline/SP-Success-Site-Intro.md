The SharePoint Success Site is built as a SharePoint communication site, and includes pre-configured pages, web part and navigation that you can further customize.


## Microsoft 365 learning pathways Web Part

A Microsoft 365 learning pathways web part is installed on your organizations instance of the SharePoint Success Site to provide an always up to date content feed. The web part connects to a Microsoft maintained SharePoint Success Site content repository that includes publicly available SharePoint success content. As the content repository is updated based on changes to the service, the installed web part will serve up the latest SharePoint success related content.

The web part can be used by administrators to customize what Microsoft maintained content they would like to include in its organization’s instance of the SharePoint Success Site, and to create and maintain their own custom playlists. See Customization  section for more detail.


## Up-to-Date Content Feed

The SharePoint Success Site up-to-date content feed includes a range of content that helps new users and existing site owners plan, create, share, and manage SharePoint Online sites:

- **Plan your site:** Guidance to help end users plan their site, including what type of SharePoint site to use, access rights, and permission strategy.
- **Create your site:** Guidance to help end users create their site, including how to brand and customize their site, and how to add content.
- **Share and manage your site:** Guidance to help end users share and manage their site.


## Site Usage Guidelines Checklist 

A checklist that can be used to set SharePoint usage policies for your organization.

The SharePoint usage policy checklist is provided as a starting point only and is not a final usage policy document.
