# View and restore deleted sites in the new SharePoint admin center

Deleted sites move to the recycle bin and are retained for 93 days. After 93 days, sites and all their content and settings are permanently deleted, including document libraries and files, lists and data, and any subsites.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you need to retain content for a minimum period of time to comply with industry regulations or internal policies, you can create a retention policy to keep a copy of it in the Preservation Hold library. For info, see [Overview of retention policies](https://support.office.com/article/5e377752-700d-4870-9b6d-12bfc12d2423). 
  
To view deleted sites in the new SharePoint admin center, go to the current SharePoint admin center, click "Try the new SharePoint admin center preview" in the upper right, and then select **Recycle bin**.

You can sort and filter sites in the recycle bin the same way you sort and filter sites on the Site management page. The recycle bin also lets you sort and filter by Time deleted.
  
## Restore a deleted site

1. Select the site.
    
2. Click **Restore**.
