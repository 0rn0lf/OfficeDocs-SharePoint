## Introduction to live events across Microsoft 365

You can create a live event wherever your audience, team, or community is currently communicating using Microsoft Stream, Microsoft Teams, Yammer, and SharePoint. Your organization’s goals and M365 configuration will determine how you leverage and combine M365 apps to host live events. 

Live events allow attendees to receive notifications and to participate in real time, with high-definition videos and interactive discussion on Teams or Yammer web, mobile, and desktop apps. After an event, it’s easy to make the recording available on an event page in SharePoint. The recording is automatically transcribed by Stream and detects changes in speakers and topics, making it easy to search for content later. 

These features become especially valuable when considering employees who are in different time zones or unable to attend live. Keep the conversation going so everyone still feels connected with leaders and peers after the event, which is a great method to overcome geographical and organizational boundaries.

## Benefits of using live event features across SharePoint, Teams, Yammer, and Stream:

Employee engagement is a major contributor to workplace satisfaction, loyalty, and productivity at any organization. Interactive live events allow program coordinators to effectively communicate business updates, training opportunities, and announcements in a way that makes an impact on the daily lives of employees and fosters ongoing collaboration and knowledge-sharing.

-	**Reach large audiences with video and interactive discussion.** Viewers can join the event regardless of their office location or work-from-home status.
-	**Share your screen or share the stage.** Easily deliver live events sharing content from your desktop or webcam. For high-profile events, connect to professional cameras, multiple content sources, and more.
-	**Empower everyone to participate.** Moderated attendee Q&A or open dialog including all participants provide multiple options for interactions during broadcasts.
-	**Watch recorded events anytime with on-demand events.** Ensure viewers never miss an event with on-demand video. Now anyone can catch up quickly and see transcripts, captions, and speaker timelines to help find the moments that matter to them.


### Summary of live event apps:

Your organization’s goals and M365 configuration will determine how you leverage and combine M365 apps to host live events.

**Teams** - If you want your audience to view the event in Microsoft Teams, create the event so your viewers can join and watch from [Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-live-events/what-are-teams-live-events). 
**Yammer** - If your audience is already using Yammer, you can create live events and have them show up directly in [Yammer](https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/manage-yammer-groups/yammer-live-events) where the viewers can participate in live discussions before the event, while watching the event, and after the event. 
**Stream** – If you don’t want viewers to watch the event in either application, you can use [Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/live-event-overview).
