## Introduction to live events across Microsoft 365

You can create a live event wherever your audience, team, or community is currently communicating using Microsoft Stream, Microsoft Teams, Yammer, and SharePoint. Your organization’s goals and M365 configuration will determine how you leverage and combine M365 apps to host live events. 

Live events allow attendees to receive notifications and to participate in real time, with high-definition videos and interactive discussion on Teams or Yammer web, mobile, and desktop apps. After an event, it’s easy to make the recording available on an event page in SharePoint. The recording is automatically transcribed by Stream and detects changes in speakers and topics, making it easy to search for content later. 

These features become especially valuable when considering employees who are in different time zones or unable to attend live. Keep the conversation going so everyone still feels connected with leaders and peers after the event, which is a great method to overcome geographical and organizational boundaries.

## Benefits of using live event features across SharePoint, Teams, Yammer, and Stream:

Employee engagement is a major contributor to workplace satisfaction, loyalty, and productivity at any organization. Interactive live events allow program coordinators to effectively communicate business updates, training opportunities, and announcements in a way that makes an impact on the daily lives of employees and fosters ongoing collaboration and knowledge-sharing.

-	**Reach large audiences with video and interactive discussion.** Viewers can join the event regardless of their office location or work-from-home status.
-	**Share your screen or share the stage.** Easily deliver live events sharing content from your desktop or webcam. For high-profile events, connect to professional cameras, multiple content sources, and more.
-	**Empower everyone to participate.** Moderated attendee Q&A or open dialog including all participants provide multiple options for interactions during broadcasts.
-	**Watch recorded events anytime with on-demand events.** Ensure viewers never miss an event with on-demand video. Now anyone can catch up quickly and see transcripts, captions, and speaker timelines to help find the moments that matter to them.


### Summary of live event apps:

Your organization’s goals and M365 configuration will determine how you leverage and combine M365 apps to host live events.

**Teams** - If you want your audience to view the event in Microsoft Teams, create the event so your viewers can join and watch from [Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-live-events/what-are-teams-live-events). 
**Yammer** - If your audience is already using Yammer, you can create live events and have them show up directly in [Yammer](https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/manage-yammer-groups/yammer-live-events) where the viewers can participate in live discussions before the event, while watching the event, and after the event. 
**Stream** – If you don’t want viewers to watch the event in either application, you can use [Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/live-event-overview).


## How to decide which app is best for your live event:

There are other considerations besides tenant configuration that will determine which apps you select depending on the level of engagement desired and governance policy of your organization. Depending on which service you create the live event from, and the type of event, there will be a different set of features available as the producer, presenter, and viewer of the live event. 

While planning your event, ask and find answers to these questions:

-	What application are users currently using to attend live events and watch videos?
-	What device are users likely to use when attending a live event or watching a video?
-	How do you want viewers to engage with event presenters?
-	What production set up is preferred?
-	What are the ideal post-event next steps?

Learn more about the [differences between live events in Teams, Yammer, and Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/live-event-m365) to get answers to these questions. Use [site and hub analytics](https://support.microsoft.com/office/view-usage-data-for-your-sharepoint-site-2fa8ddc2-c4b3-4268-8d26-a772dc55779e) to get more insights about how users are currently engaging with SharePoint content to help you make decisions. 


## Leadership connection

Bring the organization together by combining communication channels with M365 live event features across Stream, Yammer and Teams. Then, see how you can leverage SharePoint using the [leadership connection guided walkthrough](https://support.microsoft.com/office/guided-walkthrough-creating-a-leadership-site-for-your-organization-e4a984db-d277-45ab-b18e-fa117b25bb4d) example to create sites that help connect viewers with leadership by creating new communication channels and a video archive library of recorded events for later viewing.

### Company-wide events

Large events that include all employees like “town halls” or “all hands meetings” are one of the ideal scenarios for leveraging a live event. When planning for a live event, start by ensuring your M365 environment is set up and configured following guidance for each app in the *admin* section. The admin role is responsible for all the work behind the scenes work that makes the event possible and ensures the live event follows your organization’s security and compliance policies. Then, learn about live event planning and production in the section for the *producers* and *presenters*.
