# Driving SharePoint Success Site adoption

There are four success factors for driving SharePoint Online and Office 365 end user adoption:
- Stakeholders

- Scenarios

- Awareness

- Training

It is important to understand how each of these success factors can affect the uptake of new technology and how you can use them to your advantage when rolling out the SharePoint Site Owner Success Portal (SharePoint Success Site) and supporting the adoption of SharePoint Online in your organization.
For more guidance on how to drive successful adoption, refer to the Microsoft 365 adoption guide – https://aka.ms/adoptionguide. 

 
## Stakeholders

Having an actively engaged executive sponsor is one of the top drivers of project success. An executive sponsor can engender support from top-level management and their participation is essential in driving employee’s adoption of SharePoint Online.
The executive sponsor creates strategic alignment with the organization by helping set the overarching vision for SharePoint Online in the organization and communicating that vision to other leaders. They also communicate directly to end users about the importance of adoption and the value and benefits of SharePoint Online. 
Champions can evangelize and help their teams and colleagues adopt SharePoint Online into their daily work and processes. They build awareness, understanding, and engagement throughout the community.  

## Scenarios
To realize full value from SharePoint Online it is important to enable the different Lines of Business (LoBs) and departments in the organization to realize relevant business outcomes. This requires identifying and prioritizing scenarios – which are the different ways people and teams can use the capabilities of SharePoint Online to achieve their goals.
Identify and prioritize some initial scenarios to deliver and showcase the value SharePoint Online can provide stakeholders in the organization. As early wins and value is realized, there is more credibility to engage additional business stakeholders on more advanced scenarios that deliver greater value. 

## Awareness and Training
Creating awareness is a powerful way to ensure end user adoption of SharePoint Online. An awareness campaign could include internal announcements, newsletters, launch events, town hall meetings, contests and giveaways to inform and excite end users how SharePoint Online will help them. Utilize the available end user awareness campaign materials to conduct an effective SharePoint Online awareness campaign.  
Training is an essential part of the launch, enabling your end users to understand how to effectively use SharePoint Online. The types of training can include virtual live training, classroom-style, on-demand, and ‘Getting Started’ guides. Use the publicly available SharePoint training at https://support.office.com/sharepoint and Custom Learning for Office 365 <insert link> to support your training program.  

## Sharepoint End User Awareness Campaign Materials 

To help drive sustained adoption of the SharePoint Success Site and SharePoint Online we recommend a six to eight-week communication campaign to: 

- Generate awareness of the new SharePoint Success Site to end users
- Help end users be more productive by exposing them to new and compelling SharePoint Online scenarios 
- Reinforce end user learning by encouraging ongoing consumption of the SharePoint Success Site training content 


Use the available SharePoint awareness campaign materials on http://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack/resources, including pre-launch, launch and post-launch email templates to execute your SharePoint Success Site and SharePoint Online awareness campaign. All of the available SharePoint materials, including posters and flyers are available as a downloadable zip file here. 
Using these materials helps engage end users by highlighting what they can accomplish with SharePoint Online and then driving them to the SharePoint Success Site to learn how to build great sites with SharePoint Online. 

To implement an awareness campaign:

1. Send four emails to end users as part of the awareness campaign: 
- Countdown email: Three to four weeks prior to launch to build interest and make people aware of what’s coming
- Announcement email: At time of launch to make people aware of what’s available
- Tips & Tricks email 1: Two weeks post launch to reinforce awareness and learning
- Tips & Tricks email 2: Four weeks post launch to reinforce awareness and learning
2.	Customize the email templates to suit your needs, style and branding.
3.	Include a call-to-action (CTA) to the SharePoint Site Owner Success Portal in the email communications. For example: 
“Check out the SharePoint Site Owner Success Portal <Insert link > to start building your SharePoint site.”
