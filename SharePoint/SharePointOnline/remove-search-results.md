# Remove search results

As a SharePoint Online administrator, you can temporarily remove items from search results with immediate effect. The items that you can remove can be documents, pages, or sites that you don't want users to see. An example of this could be a Word document containing an invitation to an event that has been cancelled, but the organizer has not removed the document from the site yet. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This is only a quick fix! Unless you delete the items or change the permissions of items manually, they will show up again in your search results after the next crawl. 
  
1. Sign in to the Office 365 Admin Center as a search administrator.
    
2. Choose **Admin** \> **SharePoint**. You're now in the SharePoint admin center.
    
3. Choose **search**.
    
4. On the search administration page, choose **Remove Search Results**.
    
5. On the Remove Search Results page, in the **URLs to remove** box, type the URLs that you want to remove from the search results. Type one URL on each line. 
    
6. Click **Remove Now**. The URLs are immediately removed from your search results.
