> [!NOTE]
> The **Preview Features** setting isn't related to the Targeted release option, which allows you to receive new updates and features as they become available. If you're interested in signing up for that, see [Set up the Standard or Targeted release options in Office 365](/office365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365).
  
## What the Preview Features setting enables

Use the Preview Features setting to enable the following features, and others that are added in the future.
  
### Power BI integration with Excel on the web

When you use Power BI, your data is sent to the Power BI service. If you have implemented compliance policies for your SharePoint environment, these policies won't extend to the data as it's processed in Power BI. If this is a concern, select **Disable preview features** for this setting. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you disable preview features, your users will no longer be able to use Excel on the web to view and edit workbooks that rely on Power BI. 
  
## To enable or disable preview features for your organization

1. Go to the [Settings page of the new SharePoint admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint?page=settings&modern=true) and sign in with an account that has admin permissions for your organization.
