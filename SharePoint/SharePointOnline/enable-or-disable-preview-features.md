> [!NOTE]
> The **Preview Features** setting isn't related to the Targeted release option, which allows you to receive new updates and features as they become available. If you're interested in signing up for that, see [Set up the Standard or Targeted release options in Office 365](/office365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365). 
  
## What the Preview Features setting enables

Use the Preview Features setting to enable the following features, and others that are added in the future.
  
### Power BI integration with Excel Online

When you use Power BI, your data is sent to the Power BI service. If you have implemented compliance policies for your SharePoint environment, these policies won't extend to the data as it's processed in Power BI. If this is a concern, select **Disable preview features** for this setting. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you disable preview features, your users will no longer be able to use Excel Online to view and edit workbooks that rely on Power BI. 
  
## To enable or disable preview features for your organization

1. Sign in to Office 365 as a global admin or SharePoint admin.
    
2. Select the app launcher icon ![The app launcher icon in Office 365](media/e5aee650-c566-4100-aaad-4cc2355d909f.png) in the upper-left and choose **Admin** to open the Microsoft 365 admin center. (If you don't see the Admin tile, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions in your organization.) 
    
3. In the left pane, choose **Admin centers** \> **SharePoint**.
    
4. Select **settings**.
    
5. Next to **Preview Features**, select **Enable preview features** or **Disable preview features**.
