# About configuring the Search Results Web Part

The Search Results Web Part displays the results of a search query on a search results page. By default, the search results page is located at http://\<ServerName\>/results.aspx. There must be a Search Results Web Part on the search results page in order for all other search Web Parts on the page to work. 
  
You can edit the properties of the Search Results Web Part in the Search Results Web Part tool pane. These properties affect the search query and the behavior and appearance of results on the search results page.
