# SharePoint Online Planning Guide for Office 365 for business

SharePoint Online is a cloud-based service that helps organizations share and collaborate with colleagues, partners, and customers. With SharePoint Online, you can access internal sites, documents, and other information from anywhereâ€”at the office, at home, or from a mobile device.
  
Before you dive into building and configuring your organization's SharePoint Online environment, there are a few things you should think about. For example, how will your organization manage sites and users? Do you plan to make special customizations or build any solutions?
  
We've divided the planning process into five manageable steps. With each step, you'll find helpful resources to guide your decisions and get you better acquainted with SharePoint Online.
