# Success Stories

The success stories section is a gallery for organizations to populate with internal SharePoint Online success stories that inspire others in the organization about what is possible with SharePoint. 
 
## Add success stories to your portal 

If available, add SharePoint success stories to your portal. If there are no ready to publish success stories, consider working with interested departments to create SharePoint successes by building high priority and easy to implement SharePoint sites and/or solutions. Delivering these “early wins” will help inspire others in the organization on the possibilities for using SharePoint themselves to achieve important business outcomes. See adoption section for more information.

### Create form to solicit success stories 

The purpose of the “Success Stories” section is to enable peers to learn from one another on how they can use SharePoint to create sites and solutions that help them achieve their objectives. End users will be able to learn from the successes and lessons of peers who have implemented SharePoint solutions. To help solicit SharePoint success stories from your end users (for posting on the SharePoint Success Site), build a success story submission form utilizing Microsoft Forms – http://forms.office.com and add to your Success Stories page via the Microsoft Forms web part.

1.	Create a submission form at https://forms.office.com
 
To gather the right information about each SharePoint Online story, consider including the following questions:
•	Name of solution 
•	Project team members 
•	Who is the sponsor of the project? 
•	What Office 365 technologies (e.g., SharePoint, Yammer, Stream, Flow) were used as part of the solution? 
•	What were the reasons for building the SharePoint site/solution? 
•	Provide a description of the solution 
•	What impact or results has the SharePoint site/solution generated? 
•	What best practices for planning and implementing your solution would you recommend to other who are building their own SharePoint site/solution? 
 
See here for more information about how to use Microsoft Forms. 
2.	Click share and copy the link to the form

 
3.	Add a Microsoft Form web part to the Share your SharePoint success story with your colleagues form page. 
 
4. Select Add existing forms from the Microsoft Forms web part and insert your Success Story form link in the right pane Form web address.
 
The completed Success Story submission form should look like the following:
