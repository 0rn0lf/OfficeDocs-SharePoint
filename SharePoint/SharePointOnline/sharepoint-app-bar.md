# Introduction to the SharePoint App bar

The new SharePoint App bar brings together the most important content and resources that can be easily discovered no matter where you are in SharePoint. 

>[!NOTE]
> - The SharePoint App bar cannot be disabled
> - Specific SharePoint App bar tabs cannot be disabled 
> - Global navigation is the only tab that can be customized
> - The SharePoint App bar is not available for classic SharePoint tenants
> - This feature is fully supported in modern browsers, except for IE11 customers
> - Personalized content in the SharePoint App bar is enabled by Microsoft Graph



## The SharePoint App bar experience
The SharePoint App bar improves the wayfinding experience for users and dynamically displays personalized content. The SharePoint App bar can be accessed on the left-hand side anywhere in SharePoint. 
Customize the Global navigation details like the logo and source, and Microsoft Graph will do the rest of the work by dynamically displaying and updating personalized content like sites, news, and files for individual users.



### Customize Global navigation
Global navigation can be customized in the new SharePoint App bar. Global navigation enables users to discover content and navigate through your organizationâ€™s intranet more easily by surfacing important content and displaying frequently accessed information based on individual user behavior. 
Customize the Global navigation logo, the display title, and the source to fit the needs of your organization.
