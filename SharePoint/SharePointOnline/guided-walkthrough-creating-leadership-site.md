## Create your site

To make a site like the one shown here, you'll create a [Communication site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-sharepoint-topic-showcase-and-blank-communication-site-templates-94a33429-e580-45c3-a090-5512a8070732). To do this, select **Create site** from the SharePoint start page (or, if you're going to associate this site with a Hub site, navigate to the hub site and click Create site there so that the communication site is automatically be associated with that hub site).

<!-- daisy image 2-->

Next, choose **Communication site**, and then the **Blank** layout. Fill out your site name, description, and other information, and select **Finish**.

## Showcase your company branding

You can quickly and easily customize the look of your SharePoint site to reflect your professional style and brand.

<!--daisy image 4-->

**Change the look** settings are located under **Settings** <!--daisy settings icon--> in the top right corner of your SharePoint site.

<!--daisy image 5-->

You can select the site theme you want, and even customize it.

<!-- daisy image 6-->

You can change your header layout and logo when you click **Header** under **Change the look**.

<!-- daisy image 7-->

Under Change the look, you can also find options for navigation (cascade or mega menu) and footer options. For more details on changing the look of your site, see [Change the look of your SharePoint site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/change-the-look-of-your-sharepoint-site-06bbadc3-6b04-4a60-9d14-894f6a170818).

<!--daisy bookmark--> Back to top

## Make your site easy to get around

Easily edit the left and top menus to link the page to other SharePoint pages or on the Internet.

<!-- daisy image 8-->

Select **Edit** on the bottom of the left navigation to manage links there, or on the top menu to manage links there. Hover over the location in the menu where you want to add a link, and select +. Then add the type of link you want to add, your website address, and name to display in the navigation bar in the **Add a link** dialog box. Want to reorder your navigation links? Just drag them into the position you want.

For more detailed information on navigation, see [Customize the navigation on your SharePoint site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/customize-the-navigation-on-your-sharepoint-site-3cd61ae7-a9ed-4e1e-bf6d-4655f0bf25ca).

<!-- daisy bookmark -->Back to top

## Add sections and web parts

Sections make up your page, and are you place one or more web parts. While editing the page, each section will show controls to edit the layout, move, or delete the sections.

Start editing by clicking **Edit** on the top right of the page.

<!-- daisy image 9-->

The + symbol before or after a section will add a section using one of several layouts.

<!-- daisy image 10-->

For information on working with sections, see [Add or remove sections and columns on a page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-sections-and-columns-on-a-sharepoint-modern-page-fc491eb4-f733-4825-8fe2-e1ed80bd0899).

To add web parts to sections, select the plus symbol <!--daisy plus symbol--> in a section, which may appear before or after a web part in a section. Then select a web part to use. For more information on all web parts, see [Using web parts on SharePoint pages](https://support.microsoft.com/office/using-web-parts-on-sharepoint-pages-336e8e92-3e2d-4298-ae01-d404bbe751e0).

<!-- daisy image 11-->

Web parts may be edited, moved or deleted within sections. The **Edit web part** icon opens detailed controls unique to each web part type.

<!-- daisy image 12-->

<!-- daisy bookmark -->Back to top

## Focus on priorities with the Hero web part

Let your team know what’s most important with high-impact hero images, company branding, and important news. The initial impact of the Leadership site home page is created by large and eye-catching images of the Hero web part. The layout used in this example is **Three tiles**.

<!-- daisy you stopped here>
 
Hero layout

Editing the web part presents layout options. The Tiles option, such as the one shown below, presents layouts for between one and five tiles. The Layers option sets each image as a layer with the image next to the title. Up to five layers are possible, so that you can use the web part to fill the entire page.

In this example, the Hero web part is in a full-width section.

Use the Move item Move web part button button on the left to rearrange the tiles within the Hero web part.

### Share the site with site owners and members to customize

Then, use the pre-populated news post templates in **Settings > Site contents** to publish news. 
<br>

#### Edit the change management checklist
The Workplace transformation site contains a [Microsoft List](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-microsoft-lists-10b12560-fb20-471e-9258-773aec6a4a2f?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) in **Site contents** that is displayed in a [List web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-list-web-part-ef0a1b80-f8b3-443d-b04a-1e76c70b5537) on the **Get started page**. This list is intended to give end users a high-level view of what to expect through the change management journey. Edit the list to meet the need of your change management project. 

   ![Image of the hybrid workplace checklist](media/hybrid-list.png)


[Learn more about M365 lists](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-microsoft-lists-10b12560-fb20-471e-9258-773aec6a4a2f?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

#### Use Microsoft 365 learning pathways to embed training content on a page
If your tenant admin has set up [M365 Learning pathways](/office365/customlearning/custom_plancontent), you can [add pages to the site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-use-modern-pages-on-a-sharepoint-site-b3d46deb-27a6-4b1e-87b8-df851e503dec) and use the [Learning pathways web part](/office365/customlearning/custom_addwebpart) to display custom training playlists. Then, use [Learning pathways reporting capabilities](/office365/customlearning/custom_measureimpact) to measure content impact.
<br>

#### Use tools to help target content to specific audiences or protect content from specific audiences
Consider using [audience targeting](https://support.microsoft.com/office/target-content-to-a-specific-audience-on-a-sharepoint-site-68113d1b-be99-4d4c-a61c-73b087f48a81) to surface important content to specific groups or use [information barriers](https://support.microsoft.com/office/associate-information-segments-with-sharepoint-sites-2b03db07-6d3f-4297-a388-b943317a26a7#:~:text=%20Associate%20segments%20with%20a%20SharePoint%20site%20,10%20segments,%20and%20then%20select%20Save.%20More) to protect sensitive information that may appear in the **Managers** section under **Resources**. 


#### Update the site theme and branding
Edit the look of your site to align with your organization's brand. Customize the site display name, logo, theme, header layout, navigation style, and more in the [Change the look panel](https://support.microsoft.com/office/customize-your-sharepoint-site-320b43e5-b047-4fda-8381-f61e8ac7f59b?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

#### Customize site navigation
Site navigation is important because it helps users immediately understand what can be accomplished on a given site. The most effective SharePoint sites help viewers find what they need quickly so that they can use the information to make decisions, learn about what is going on, access the tools they need, or engage with colleagues to help solve a problem. [Learn how to edit site navigation](https://support.microsoft.com/office/customize-the-navigation-on-your-sharepoint-site-3cd61ae7-a9ed-4e1e-bf6d-4655f0bf25ca?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).
