# Manage search dictionaries

Learn how to manage search dictionaries. You can use search dictionaries to include or exclude company names to be extracted from the contents of your indexed documents, or you can include or exclude words for query spelling correction.
  
## Manage company name extraction
<a name="__toc342653321"> </a>

For company name extraction to work, that is, for a company name to be pulled from your content and for it to be mapped to the managed property **companies**, you have to make sure that:
  
- The managed property setting **Company name extraction** is enabled on the managed property that you want to extract company names from. This setting is available for the managed properties **Title**, **Body** and **Notes**. See also [Manage the search schema in SharePoint Online](manage-the-search-schema.md).
    
- The name of the company that you want to extract is in the prepopulated company name dictionary or in the **Company Inclusions** list. 
    
Once you have done this, you can then use the managed property **companies** to create refiners based on the extracted company name in the **Refinement Web** **Part**, on the search results page.

## Manage query spelling correction
<a name="__toc342653324"> </a>

If you or another user enters a word in a search query that appears to be misspelled, the search results page helps you out by displaying query spelling corrections. These are important words in your indexed documents. This is also known as "Did you mean?".
  
For example, if you enter a query that contains the word "ampitheater", the query spelling correction would show "amphitheater" if this term is available in many places in your indexed documents. You can add terms such as the one just shown to the **Query Spelling Inclusions** list, or to the **Query Spelling Exclusions** list to influence how you want query spelling corrections to be applied or not. It takes up to 10 minutes for any changes to the **Query Spelling Inclusions** or the **Query Spelling Exclusions** list to take effect.
