# Search Center settings

As a SharePoint Online administrator, you can specify where searches should go by specifying the URL of your Search Center. For example, if you have created an Enterprise Search Center where users can search everything in your company, you can enter the URL of that site here. 
  
## Enter the address of your Search Center
<a name="__goback"> </a>

1. Sign in to Office 365 as a global admin or SharePoint admin.
    
2. Select the app launcher icon ![The app launcher icon in Office 365](media/e5aee650-c566-4100-aaad-4cc2355d909f.png) in the upper-left and choose **Admin** to open the Office 365 admin center. (If you don't see the Admin tile, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions in your organization.) 
    
3. In the left pane, choose **Admin centers** \> **SharePoint**.
    
4. Choose **search**. 
    
5. On the search administration page, choose **Search Center Settings**.
