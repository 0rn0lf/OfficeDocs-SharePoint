# Introduction to the SharePoint Online Management Shell

As an Office 365 global or SharePoint admin for your organization, you can use the SharePoint Online Management Shell to manage users, sites, and site collections. The SharePoint Online Management Shell is a Windows PowerShell module that lets you run command-line operations. It makes performing batch operations more efficient, and is the only way to perform some management tasks in SharePoint and OneDrive.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you're new to Office 365 or SharePoint Online, we recommend getting familiar with the SharePoint admin center first. To get started, see [Manage site collections and global settings in the SharePoint admin center](manage-site-collections-and-global-settings-in-the-sharepoint-admin-center).
