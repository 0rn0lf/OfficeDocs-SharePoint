# Change the Links list on the SharePoint home page

 As a global or SharePoint admin in Office 365, you can feature the sites and content you want on the SharePoint home page by changing the **Links** list on the left side. To add links to a SharePoint Server page, see [Video: Add a link to a page](https://support.office.com/article/F9B329F9-67BB-4258-A686-9CD98415E7CA).
  
> [!NOTE]
> Some functionality is introduced gradually to organizations that have opted in to the [Set up the Standard or Targeted release options in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/3b3adfa4-1777-4ff0-b606-fb8732101f47). This means that you may not yet see this feature or it may look different than what is described in the help articles. > To learn more about the SharePoint home page, see [Find news, sites, and portals in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/6b85097a-87e0-4611-a29a-dfd49b1a1220). 
  
To view the SharePoint home page in Office 365:
  
1. Sign in to Office 365. For help, see [Where do I sign in?](https://support.office.com/article/17e859dc-88be-45a0-97be-a8837efb2c24.aspx#BKMK_WhereSignIn).
    
2. Select SharePoint from the list of apps.

> [!NOTE]
> If you had custom promoted sites in classic view of the SharePoint Sites page, the Links section of the SharePoint home page is pre-populated with those sites. The pre-population of promoted sites in the Links list happens only once when the first user visits the new SharePoint home page. If you go back to classic view and change the promoted sites, the changes will not be reflected in the Links list on the SharePoint home page.
