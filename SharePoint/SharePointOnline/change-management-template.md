<br>

**Use and consult –** Use [Microsoft Lists](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-microsoft-lists-10b12560-fb20-471e-9258-773aec6a4a2f?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) to help your organization manage tasks and knowledge checks associated with training and change management objectives.
<br>

**Sustain –** Help users practice and sustain new skillsets and habits by leveraging micro-learning content like quick tips and [publishing regular news posts](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-share-news-on-your-sharepoint-sites-495f8f1a-3bef-4045-b33a-55e5abe7aed7) sharing change management success stories. 



## How to use the Workplace transformation site template
The Workplace transformation site can be used to drive any topic or scope of organizational change. The site template helps organizations to successfully manage the people side of their organization change management to ensure all impacted employees are informed, have support, and know where they can learn more about upcoming changes.

**Examples of the types of change projects that could benefit from the workplace transformation template:**
<br>

**New process –** Communicate and manage changes to data security policies, new contract management workflows, or project intake processes.
<br>

**Merger and acquisition –** Onboard new employees and help current employees understand what to expect and how to work together.
<br>

**New systems –** Roll out a new employee benefits program, or help employees adopt new tools and apps.


### Pre-populated content focuses on the hybrid workplace
The workplace transformation site features pre-populated content that revolves around helping organizations transition to a hybrid workplace. The hybrid workplace is one that is flexible when and where people do their work. Many organizations plan to allow employees to work from home up to 50% of the time, which means the organization will need to adopt new ways of working to ensure wellbeing and productivity.

### Considerations for M365 Learning Pathways
[Microsoft 365 learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/) is a customizable, on-demand learning solution that displays playlists using the M365 Learning pathways web part right onto SharePoint pages. Consider using the M365 Learning pathways solution in combination with the workplace transformation site to embed training playlists on SharePoint pages. 

Learn more about [how to provision the M365 Learning pathways solution for the first time](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/custom_provision), how to [find Microsoft-maintained content packs]
(https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/custom_plancontent), and [how to custom learning pathways and playlists](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/custom_overview). 


## Step 1: Get started provisioning the Workplace transformation site

> [!NOTE]
> -	Tenant administrators’ credentials (or higher) are required to provision a template from the lookbook
> -	The workplace transformation site will take about 15 minutes to provision 


1.	Start by navigating to the [SharePoint look book](https://lookbook.microsoft.com/) and selecting the work transformation template. Select **Add to your tenant**.
2.	Then, select a site name, URL, and email address where an email confirmation will be sent when the site is successfully created.
3.	Select **Provision**, and in less than 15 minutes you will receive an email confirmation with a link to your new site.
<br> 
Learn more about [provisioning site templates from the lookbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/add-sample-site). 


















> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have Site owner or Site member permissions to the SharePoint Success Site and the M365 learning pathways administrative page in order to make customizations..



1.	**SharePoint communication site** - The site comes [pre-populated with content and web parts](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/overview-sss#what-comes-with-a-sharepoint-success-site) that can be further customized to fit the needs of your organization.

2.	**Microsoft 365 learning pathways** - [M365 learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/#:~:text=Microsoft%20365%20learning%20pathways%20is%20a%20customizable%2C%20on-demand,adoption%20of%20Microsoft%20365%20services%20in%20your%20organization..) is a solution that enables you to leverage existing content produced by Microsoft, as well as the ability to create and enable your own training playlists.

3.	**Up-to-date SharePoint training content feed** - Content in the SharePoint Success Site is updated by Microsoft as SharePoint evolves and can be customized to align with your organization's site creation policy.

   ![Image of the SharePoint Success Site landing page](media/sss-landing.png)


## Before you share the site with end-users
 
 There are several customization opportunities to align the site content, look, and feel with your organization. Before you publish your site and share it with users, review and customize the following elements:

- Training content in M365 learning pathways 
- The SharePoint Success Site template 
- The Yammer conversation, People, and Forms web parts
- Content in the site usage guidelines page
- Content in the success story page
- Branding details like the site logo and theme
- Navigational elements


#### Summary of site requirements and permissions
Before getting started customizing, ensure that the SharePoint Success Site has been set up by your SharePoint administrator. You need to be a Site owner or Site member for **both** M365 learning pathways *and* the SharePoint Success Site in order to have permission to make site customizations.

If you’re not sure your tenant has the site, contact your SharePoint administrator to verify that the SharePoint Success Site been provisioned and ask for the M365 learning pathways and SharePoint Success Site URLs. If you are the Global admin (formerly called the Tenant admin) and M365 learning pathways has not been provisioned, see the [provisioning guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/provision-sss#provision-the-sharepoint-success-site-1).


**Who has permissions to customize the site template?**
- Global admins and SharePoint admins
- SharePoint Site owner or Site member level permissions
<br>

**Who can create custom playlists and hide or show content in M365 learning pathways?**
- The Site collection administrator for M365 learning pathways
- SharePoint Site owner or Site member permissions for M365 learning pathways
<br>

**Who has permissions to use the SharePoint Success Site as a user?**
- Office 365 user permissions or SharePoint Site visitor permissions or higher


## Get started customizing
Once you confirm the necessary access and permission to customize the site, you are ready to get started with the customization process.
The SharePoint Success Site is hosted in your Microsoft 365 tenant, so you'll need to sign into Microsoft 365 and then navigate to the site. 

##### Sign in
1.	Open a web browser and navigate to [office.com](https://www.office.com/) or your organization’s sign-in location.
2.	Sign in with your username and password.
3.	Navigate to the location of the site using the URL supplied by your tenant administrator or select SharePoint from the Microsoft 365 home page, and then select the **SharePoint Success Site**.


### Explore and review the pre-populated training content

> ![Image of the M365 learning pathways, SharePoint success site page](media/m365-lp-sss.png)


**Navigate to the Microsoft 365 learning pathways admin page:**

1. Navigate to the Microsoft 365 learning pathways by selecting **Home > Administration**.
2. Next, select the **gear icon** in the web part.
3. Then, select **Home > Learning pathways administration**.
4. Select the **SharePoint Success Site** tab.

**Show or hide sections to the playlist content**

Select which content to display in your SharePoint Success Site by [hiding and showing](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/custom_hideshowsub) subcategories of content. For example, if you don’t want users to have access to the Advanced site creation section, you can hide that subcategory so it won't be visible to end-users. Decide which content is appropriate for the purpose of your SharePoint Success Site. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hiding playlists does not hide the associated page in the SharePoint Success Site, nor will adding custom playlists automatically create site pages for them. [Add](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-use-modern-pages-on-a-sharepoint-site-b3d46deb-27a6-4b1e-87b8-df851e503dec#bkmk_addpage) or [delete](https://support.microsoft.com/office/delete-a-page-from-a-sharepoint-site-1d4197b8-31b6-460d-906b-3fb492a51db1) pages within the site as needed.

**Add your own custom playlists**

With Microsoft 365 learning pathways, you can [create custom playlists](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/custom_createnewplaylist) that are tailored to the unique needs of your organization. For example, create a playlist for team site integration with Microsoft Teams.


### Customize the look and feel of your site
The following sections of the SharePoint Success Site can be customized to meet your requirements, prior to sharing with end users. There are several different ways you can make the SharePoint Success Site template your own. Customize the following elements of your site to fit the need of your organization:

- Update the SharePoint Success Site [branding](https://support.microsoft.com/office/customize-your-sharepoint-site-320b43e5-b047-4fda-8381-f61e8ac7f59b) to align with your organization.
- Customize the [Hero web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-hero-web-part-d57f449b-19a0-4b0d-8ce3-be5866430645) to include images of real sites in your organization where possible.
- [Add web parts](https://support.microsoft.com/office/using-web-parts-on-sharepoint-pages-336e8e92-3e2d-4298-ae01-d404bbe751e0) to your site as needed.
- Customize the [page layouts](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-sections-and-columns-on-a-sharepoint-modern-page-fc491eb4-f733-4825-8fe2-e1ed80bd0899) as needed.
- Add [new pages](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-use-modern-pages-on-a-sharepoint-site-b3d46deb-27a6-4b1e-87b8-df851e503dec) to additional support or training resources.

### Customize the site navigation
As a Site owner you have full control of the site navigation. Use the following resources to help you make changes that align with business outcomes:

- Customize the [site navigation](https://support.microsoft.com/office/customize-the-navigation-on-your-sharepoint-site-3cd61ae7-a9ed-4e1e-bf6d-4655f0bf25ca). 
- [Associate this site with a hub](https://support.microsoft.com/office/associate-a-sharepoint-site-with-a-hub-site-ae0009fd-af04-4d3d-917d-88edb43efc05).
- Use [audience targeting](https://support.microsoft.com/office/target-navigation-news-and-files-to-specific-audiences-33d84cb6-14ed-4e53-a426-74c38ea32293) to target specific navigational links to specific users. For example, in the **Home** navigation drop down you will see a shortcut to the M365 learning pathways administration page. Target that page to Site owners for the SharePoint Success Site to prevent end-users from seeing it.
- [Delete unwanted pages](https://support.microsoft.com/office/delete-a-page-from-a-sharepoint-site-1d4197b8-31b6-460d-906b-3fb492a51db1) if you need to.

### Customize specific web parts

1. **Yammer conversations web part** - Use a Yammer web part to connect new SharePoint Site owners with extra support from current SharePoint Site owners and admins. Connect your Yammer community to the [Yammer conversations web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-a-yammer-web-part-in-sharepoint-online-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da#conversations).

   ![Image of the Yammer conversations web part](media/sss-yammer.png)

2. **People web part** - Edit the [People web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/show-people-profiles-on-your-page-with-the-people-web-part-7e52c5f6-2d72-48fa-a9d3-d2750765fa05) to display contact information so new Site owners can reach out for help.

   ![Image of the People web part](media/sss-people.png)

3. **Button web part** - Edit the [Button web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-button-web-part-d2e37c48-11e8-45b9-8d9e-abdaa97c2a7a) to link to a [Microsoft Form](https://support.microsoft.com/office/introduction-to-microsoft-forms-bb1dd261-260f-49aa-9af0-d3dddcea6d69) to collect success stories from Site owners. Consider using the [Forms web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-microsoft-forms-web-part-d4b4d3ce-7860-41e4-8a98-76380efe7256?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) to embed a custom form that allows SharePoint Site owners to easily share their success stories.

   ![Image of the Button web part](media/sss-form.png)

#### Customize the Success stories page
The success stories section is a gallery for organizations to showcase internal SharePoint site success stories to inspire new Site owners with their site creation. 

![Image of an example success story](media/sss-success-story-example.png)

If available, add SharePoint success stories to your portal. If there are no ready-to-publish success stories, consider working with internal partners to create SharePoint successes by building high priority sites that align with business outcomes. Highlighting these “early wins” will help inspire others in the organization on the possibilities for using SharePoint themselves to achieve business outcomes. 

**Here are some sample questions to consider using in your form:**

- Name of solution 
- Project team members 
- Who is the sponsor of the project? 
- What Microsoft 365 technologies (e.g., SharePoint, Yammer, Stream, Flow) were used as part of the solution? 
- What were the reasons for building the SharePoint site? 
- Provide a description of the solution 
- What impact or results has the SharePoint site generated? 
- What best practices for planning and implementing your solution would you recommend to other who are building their own SharePoint site? 

Learn more about how to [create a form](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-form-with-microsoft-forms-4ffb64cc-7d5d-402f-b82e-b1d49418fd9d) using Microsoft Forms.

Or, [delete unwanted pages](https://support.microsoft.com/office/delete-a-page-from-a-sharepoint-site-1d4197b8-31b6-460d-906b-3fb492a51db1) if you do not want to include this page in your site.


### Customize the Site creation guidelines page
To ensure the proper use of SharePoint in your organization it is important to communicate your site usage guidelines to new and existing site owners. This should include guidelines for how people should create sites in your tenant, design standards, and how people should share information using SharePoint and Microsoft 365. 

![Image of the site creation guidelines page](media/sss-creation-guidelines.png)

The example site creation and usage guidelines are not intended to be a final policy document. Once you have created your own unique usage guidelines, remove the content from the Site usage guidelines page and replace it with your organization’s usage guidelines. See how to [create and use modern pages](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-use-modern-pages-on-a-sharepoint-site-b3d46deb-27a6-4b1e-87b8-df851e503dec?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) on a SharePoint site. 

Create site usage guidelines that are appropriate for your organization by reviewing our [site usage guidelines checklist](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/sites-usage-guidelines) that will help you create guidelines that:

- Inspire discussion and consideration amongst your stakeholders on important site usage policies.
- Provide links to resources that can help you better understand the options related to key policy decisions.
- Provide sample text to get you started in creating your own policies.

**Here are some topics to consider as you create your own site creation and usage guidelines:**

- How to get a new SharePoint site
- Guidelines for using site templates
- Site design, branding, and customization
- Rules for sharing and permissions
- Capacity guidelines
- Site lifecycle policy


#### Provide contact information for SharePoint support
If your organization has an intranet team that will be supporting site owners, consider profiling the intranet team members on the SharePoint Success Site homepage using the People web part. 
The home page of the SharePoint Success Site has a [People web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/show-people-profiles-on-your-page-with-the-people-web-part-7e52c5f6-2d72-48fa-a9d3-d2750765fa05?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) you can use to add your own Intranet team. If you will not have a dedicated team supporting site owners, remove the current People web part.


## Share the site with end-users
[Share your site with others](https://support.microsoft.com/office/share-a-site-958771a8-d041-4eb8-b51c-afea2eae3658).Partner with others in your organization to ensure the SharePoint Success Site is widely known and adopted. 

Key success factors to managing the SharePoint Success Site:

- Celebrate the launch of your SharePoint Success Site.
- Create and post news announcing the new resource.
- Ensure users have an outlet for questions and feedback.
- Plan to review the SharePoint Success site as needed to ensure content and site usage policies are still relevant .
- Build culture and community by integrating a [Yammer web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-a-yammer-web-part-in-sharepoint-online-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da#conversations).
- Integrate and customize your organization’s high-value training content.

#### Adoption and awareness strategy

To help build, grow, and sustain your SharePoint adoption efforts, its recommended to [create a SharePoint user group community in Yammer](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-group-in-yammer-b407af4f-9a58-4b12-b43e-afbb1b07c889).  Your SharePoint champions and power users can answer SharePoint related questions posted in the Yammer group and encourage site owners to share their successes and best practices. See the [champions guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/champ_findthem) for more information on how to identify and build a successful champions program. 

To increase visibility and engagement within your portal champions community, integrate the Yammer group hosting your community into the SharePoint Success Site using the [Yammer conversations web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-a-yammer-web-part-in-sharepoint-online-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da).
