# Introduction to SharePoint Online

SharePoint Online is a cloud-based service that helps organizations share and collaborate with colleagues, partners, and customers. With SharePoint, you can access internal sites, documents, and other information from anywhereâ€”at the office, at home, or from a mobile device.
  
Before you dive into building and configuring your organization's SharePoint environment, there are a few things you should think about. For example, how will you manage sites with the objective to collaborate (team sites) and those with the objective to broadcast and share content for viewing (communication sites)
  
We've divided the planning process into three steps. With each step, you'll find helpful resources to guide your decisions and get you better acquainted with SharePoint.
