# Change your SharePoint domain name

Unfortunately, it isn't possible to change the SharePoint Online domain name for your organization in Office 365. For example, if the name of your organization changes from "Contoso" to "Fourth Coffee," you can't change  *contoso.sharepoint.com*  to  *fourthcoffee.sharepoint.com*. 
  
To use the domain name  *fourthcoffee.sharepoint.com*  , you would need to purchase a new Office 365 subscription and move all email, files, and any other data you want to keep to the new subscription. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> To change the name of a site, for example, from  *https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sample1*  to  *https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sample2*, you need to access the modern SharePoint admin center from where this action can be performed on sites. See [SharePoint Online Can Now Rename Site URLs](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365/SharePoint-Online-Can-Now-Rename-Site-URLs/m-p/512293) for more details.
