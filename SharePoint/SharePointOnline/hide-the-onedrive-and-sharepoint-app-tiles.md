# Hide the OneDrive and SharePoint app tiles

By default, the OneDrive and SharePoint app tiles appear in the app launcher and on the Office 365 portal. If your subscription doesn't include one of these services, or if you don't want users using one of them, you can hide the app tile for it.

> [!NOTE]
> Hiding these services doesn't remove them for users. If users have saved the address of the service, they will still be able to access it. > If users click a tile for a service they don't have, they will see an Access Denied message. 
  
## To hide app tiles

1. Sign in to Office 365 as a global admin or SharePoint admin.
    
2. Select the app launcher icon ![The icon that looks like a waffle and represents a button click that will reveal multiple application tiles for selection.](media/3b8a317e-13ba-4bd4-864e-1ccd47af39ee.png) in the upper-left and choose **Admin** to open the Office 365 admin center. (If you don't see the Admin tile, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions in your organization.) 
    
3. In the left pane, choose **Admin centers** > **SharePoint**.
    
4. Choose **settings** on the left. 
    
5. In **Show or Hide Options**, choose the tile you want to hide.

    > If you have an Office 365 Education subscription, you also have the option to hide **OneNote Class Notebooks** and **OneNote Staff Notebooks**. > Hiding the OneDrive tile also hides the Office Online tiles (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote). 
  
6. Choose **OK** to save the settings.
