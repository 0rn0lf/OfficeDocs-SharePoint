# FAQ

### How long will it take to install the portal in our tenant environment?

In our testing it took 15 minutes. This does not include time required to customize the site to your requirements. 

### Can we make the SharePoint Success Site a subsite of our primary SharePoint site collection? 
No. The training site is based on a communication site template, which is always meant to be a root site collection.
Important related note: Itâ€™s important to consider the permissions your end users will need to access the portal. Most organizations have defined security or user groups. You must ensure the appropriate access groups are permissioned accordingly to the new site after site deployment.  

### What support will Microsoft provide for the SharePoint Success Site? 

The following components of the pilot that could require support:

**Package Deployment**. Microsoft will support the SharePoint Online Site Owner Success Portal package and will help customers troubleshoot issues related to its implementation.

**Communication Site**. Microsoft will direct pilot customers with any SharePoint Communication Sites related issues to the existing public support channels.

**Custom Learning Web Part**.
