# Plan an intelligent SharePoint intranet

SharePoint offers a wide variety of options and tools to create intranet sites in your organization. Moving your intranet to SharePoint might take a while, particularly if you already have extensive intranet content. In this article, we'll look at how to plan a new SharePoint intranet with a focus on quickly bringing sites on line and getting a return on your investment.

We'll cover how to:

- Review your current intranet and your existing SharePoint environment
- Identify and prioritize your business scenarios for intranet sites
- Identify one key scenario to prototype and pilot
- Launch the pilot and engage with your users

## Review your existing intranet

Your current intranet may be composed of sites from different business groups, such as HR, IT, Facilities, Engineering, and others. As a first step to planning your new SharePoint intranet, we recommend taking an inventory of your existing sites and meeting with the owners of each to determine their business requirements for new sites.

As part of these meetings, you can identify the business needs that are addressed by each existing site as well as any requirements you might have for new sites.

## Identify business scenarios

Work with the intranet site owners in your organization to determine what an ideal intranet site would look like to them:

- What do you want visitors to the site to be able to accomplish?
- What tools or technology do you want them to use to accomplish this?
- How will they know that they're successful?

For example, create a table like this to list out business scenarios that you want to address with intranet sites:

|**As someone in...**|**I want to...**|**Using...**|**I know this is successful when...**|
|:-------------------|:---------------|:-----------|:------------------------------------|
|HR Benefits|Educate employees about benefits|Announcements and training videos|Help requests are reduced|
|Engineering|Instruct engineers on coding excellence|Streaming events and formal training|Training completed successfully|
|Leadership|Foster positive employee agreement about company strategy|News posts, streaming events, Yammer conversations|Yammer conversations show positive sentiment|

When you and your intranet stakeholders have compiled a list of business scenarios, the next step is to prioritize. While you may ultimately create intranet sites to address all of the identified scenarios, prioritizing which project to do first will help you achieve early success and user engagement as efficiently as possible.

Review each scenario on the list for the following criteria:

- Does it solve a real problem?
- How many people will use it?
- Can it be built in a reasonable time frame?
- What's the return on investment?

Analyze each scenario for its positive impact on your users with respect to the ease of implementation. A high impact site that can be built with a minimum of customization can be an ideal first project.

## Choose a pilot scenario

From the high priority scenarios, identify which ones meet these three key criteria:

- Can you build a prototype quickly (a few days)?
- Is there a committed sponsor?
- Is there a specific audience for a pilot?

Consider plotting your business scenarios on a grid such as that below and review with your intranet stakeholders and IT department to choose the best option to start with.

When you've decided on which solution to build first, work with the business leaders for that area to work out the objectives for the site, who will be responsible for driving success in this area, and the metrics that you'll use to measure success. For example:

|**Objective**|**Business owner**|**Success metric**|
|:------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
|Broadcast Leadership Q&As live|Alex Wilbur|Live stream and recording views|
|Weekly news post by a senior leader|Megan Bowen|News post views and shares|
|Company business value slides known and used|Adele Vance|Slide downloads and sales team alignment|

When you've listed out the primary objectives for the site, review who the site's users are and their goals:

- Who are the target users of the solution?
- What are their goals?
- How do they get their job done today?
- What systems and tools do they use today?
- Who are the champions who will help them transition to the new solution?

Once you have compiled this information, create a design brief to help map out the user journey of how you want the site to operate. For example:

|||
|:----|:----|
|Scenario|One-stop site for employees to hear from company leadership, learn the company's goals, and hear the latest news from customer meetings and industry events.|
|Users|All company employees|
|Value|Increase employee awareness and alignment with company strategy and business opportunities.|
|User journey|News post is sent to the company announcing a leadership Q&A meeting.<br>Allan goes to the leadership portal to watch the event live.<br>John uses Yammer to ask a question at the meeting.<br>John shares the recording link with coworkers.|
|Metrics|Live event views<br>Event recording views<br>Yammer engagement|
|Stretch goals|Continued Yammer engagement<br>Improving employee sentiment (survey)|

## Choose solution components

SharePoint offers a variety of building blocks that you can use to create an intranet:

- **[Communication sites](https://support.office.com/article/94A33429-E580-45C3-A090-5512A8070732)** - Use communication sites to share news, reports, statuses, and other information through a variety of templates and web parts.
- **Home sites** - Create an engaging home for your organization, division, or function.
- **[Hub sites](planning-hub-sites.md)** - Use hub sites to organize related sites and teams and centralize news, search, and content management.
- **[SharePoint news](https://support.office.com/article/C2DCEE50-F5D7-434B-8CB9-A7FEEFD9F165)** - Use the news web part to post important or interesting stories, announcements, people news, status updates, and more that can include graphics and rich formatting.
- **[Yammer](https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/yammer-landing-page)** - Use Yammer to connect with people across your organization beyond the boundaries of projects, functions, and departments.
- **[Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/forms-pro)** - Use forms to create custom quizzes, surveys, questionnaires, registrations and more.
- **[Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream)** - Use Stream to deliver live and on-demand meetings, events, and training.

For the scenario that you've decided to build, choose the components that you'll need to use to meet the site's business objectives. We recommend creating a rapid prototype and granting access to your key stakeholders. This provides a substantive framework for further discussions and revisions of the design.
