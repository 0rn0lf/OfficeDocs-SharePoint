# Plan an intelligent SharePoint intranet

Inspire participants about what’s possible with Intelligent Intranets
Develop current state understanding of existing SharePoint environment
Identify and prioritize business scenarios 
Identify one key business solution to prototype

Business priorities for each role, then prioritize from that


Communications and employee experiences
Knowledge sharing and discovery
Shared content and business solutions




The building blocks
SharePoint news
transform internal communications to keep people informed and engaged

Communication sites
reach a broad audience across the organization with a dynamic intranet site

Home sites
create an engaging home for your organization, division, or function

Hub sites
organize related sites & teams to centralize news, search and content management


Create your own Scenarios
As someone in *team*
Sales Management

I want to *do this task*
train my sales reps, who are geographically dispersed, on new products we bring to market

Using *this application of the technology*
SharePoint Communication Sites, News and Microsoft Stream to create a Sales Training Portal that alerts sales reps of new product training videos on the portal they can consume while on the road

I’ll know this is successful when *something happens*
my sales team completes the training and indicates in a survey they have improved their ability to sell the new product


Tips for identifying scenarios
Decision Criteria:
Does it solve a real problem?
Is it obtainable?
Will it be widely used (how many people)?
How much ROI does it provide?
