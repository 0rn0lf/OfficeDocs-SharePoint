This intranet hub article provides guidance on how to plan and create your intranet in the modern, intelligent way. The Modern experience in SharePoint is designed to be compelling, flexible, and more performant. The [modern experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/guide-to-sharepoint-modern-experience) makes it easier for anyone to create beautiful, dynamic sites and pages that are accessible and mobile-ready. Modern SharePoint supports intelligent workplaces - those that leverage the collective knowledge of current users, share and collaborate easily, and engage audiences with targeted content and news.

### Summary of roles and key tasks

#### Company intranet owner

The company intranet owner works with business owners and IT to prioritize the intranet projects in your portfolio for the greatest business benefit in the shortest time.

Start by getting inspired with the [SharePoint lookbook](https://aka.ms/sharepointlookbook). The lookbook provides examples of intranet pages that you can build in SharePoint and will give you an idea of the possibilities. Keep these in mind as you proceed through the planning and implementation process.

Next, start to [plan your intelligent SharePoint intranet](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/plan-intranet) by reviewing your existing intranet and determining which project to start with for your best return on investment. As you prioritize your intranet projects, consider how to get the [best performance and scalability](https://docs.microsoft.com/SharePoint/portal-health) from the portals that you build. If your existing intranet is using SharePoint server, consider how [migrating your content to SharePoint Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepointmigration/migrate-to-sharepoint-online) fits into your overall plan.

Then, choose a project to start and meet with the business owners in that area of your organization to plan the project.

Keep in mind these key success factors as you plan and implement your intranet:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Have an executive sponsor and find intranet champions
> * Design for simplicity and longevity 
> * Ask for feedback from users during all stages of the design process
> * Establish KPIs and regularly communicate them from project start to finish

**Key tasks:**

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Organize your intranet

A critical part of your SharePoint intranet is your site architecture. By using a series of [communication sites](https://support.office.com/article/94A33429-E580-45C3-A090-5512A8070732) and [hub sites](planning-hub-sites.md), you can create an intuitive intranet with common navigation across sites and an easy-to-manage permissions structure. See [Planning navigation for the modern SharePoint experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/plan-navigation-modern-experience) for a detailed look at site navigation in SharePoint.

*Start by -* Developing an understanding about what you need your intranet to accomplish and start organizing content assets and requirements. Organize depending on the needs of the business - by region, department, or function.  

*You'll know your done when -* Business owners and end-users confirm they can find and have access to the content that makes their jobs more productive.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Brand your intranet

Branding is an important part of your intranet. With SharePoint, you can [add branding your SharePoint site](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/branding-sharepoint-online-sites-modern-experience), and also [customize the Office 365 theme for your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/setup/customize-your-organization-theme).

*Start by -* Answering - Do you need a consistent brand across all sites or will different divisions, departments, or groups in your organization have their own? Then, collect approved brand assets like brand colors, logos, and images depending on your company's branding requirements.

*You'll know your done when -* You've determined the end-to-end look of the intranet from the home page to hub sites and individual sites.

#### IT/Admins

- Implement the needed platform integration steps - such as with databases or line of business applications - needed by your business owners for their intranet portals.
- Training business owners, content creators, and end users

Keep in mind these key success factors as you plan and implement your intranet:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Establish a governance plan that allows for self-service sites creation
> * Audit content to ensure quality and relevancy before migrating
> * Enable social connection that encourages communication, engagement, and collaboration 
> * Train your content creators and your end users

**Key tasks:**

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Plan the governance strategy

Governance is the set of policies, roles, and processes that control how your organization's business divisions and IT teams work together to achieve its goal - ensuring company content and communications are secure and viewers benefit from a consistent experience. Every organization has unique needs and goals that influence its approach to governance. Some details to consider when planning your [governance strategy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/governance-overview): naming conventions, guest access, classification of sites, groups, and files.

*Start by -* Understanding the rules and requirements of your organization, in combination with the needs of business owners and site owners. Then, develop a plan alongside IT, HR and senior leadership that allows employees to maximize the value of SharePoint with minimal oversight in a way that's compliant.

*You'll know your done when -* When governance stakeholders, business owners, and content creators can work effortlessly in SharePoint without slowing the rhythm of business. 

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Migrate content from your existing intranet

Your existing intranet may contain content from a variety of sources located on different platforms. A key task in creating your modern SharePoint intranet is determining the state of your existing content and deciding which content to migrate to the new intranet.

Your current business owners and site owners may be best suited to evaluate if content should be migrated, and you may want to have them perform the actual migration, depending on what's involved. They may need your assistance depending on the quantity and location of the content to be moved. The [SharePoint Migration Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepointmigration/migrate-to-sharepoint-online) can help you migrate content from SharePoint server and from file shares. [Mover](https://mover.io) can help you migrate from other cloud providers.

*Start by -* Working with business leaders and other content stakeholders to review your existing content for relevance and accuracy.

*You'll know your done when -* A curated set of content has been migrated to SharePoint.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Customize SharePoint to meet your business needs

With the SharePoint modern experience, you can create an engaging, easy to maintain intranet without the need for customization. We highly recommend using SharePoint default experiences where possible. This will provide easier change management over time.

If you do need to customize SharePoint, SharePoint provides Framework solutions, apps, add-ins, and solutions to help you meet your business needs. See [SharePoint development](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev) for more information.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Train your content creators

Depending on their background, the people in your organization may need some help getting started with SharePoint. [Microsoft 365 learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/) provides a way to bring a curated set of Microsoft content to your users. Other references that can help your content creators manage updates to the site include:

- [Create a document library in SharePoint](https://support.office.com/client/306728fe-0325-4b28-b60d-f902e1d75939)
- [Create a list in SharePoint](https://support.office.com/article/0D397414-D95F-41EB-ADDD-5E6EFF41B083)
- [Add texts and tables to your page](https://support.office.com/article/729c0aa1-bc0d-41e3-9cde-c60533f2c801)
- [Add content to your page using the Embed web part](https://support.office.com/article/721f3b2f-437f-45ef-ac4e-df29dba74de8)
- [Use the image web part](https://support.office.com/article/A63B335B-AD0A-4954-A65D-33C6AF68BEB2)
- [Use the News web part on a SharePoint page](https://support.office.com/article/C2DCEE50-F5D7-434B-8CB9-A7FEEFD9F165)

*Start by -* Determining your users needs for training on SharePoint and making these references known
*You'll know your done when -* Questions about SharePoint intranet usage on company social media channels and through the help desk have decreased to a modest level.


#### Business owners and site owners

As a business owner, you may be responsible for intranet content for a particular area of your organization such as HR or facilities. With SharePoint, you can easily create and maintain the content that you need. Look over the [SharePoint lookbook](https://aka.ms/sharepointlookbook) for some ideas before you start your intranet planning.

Keep in mind these key success factors as you plan and implement your intranet:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Have an executive sponsor
> * Design for simplicity and longevity 
> * Ask for feedback from users during all stages of the design process
> * Work with champions and thought leaders in the organization
> * Establish KPIs and regularly communicate them from project start to finish

**Key tasks:**

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Migrate your data

One of the largest tasks in creating a new intranet site is migrating your existing data to SharePoint. We highly recommend doing a content audit to see what's being used, what's up-to-date, and what's no longer needed and can be unpublished. Oftentimes, organizations can achieve higher user satisfaction and easier maintenance by removing content that's no longer needed. This also reduces the amount of content that you need to migrate to SharePoint.

If you're migrating files from SharePoint Server on-premises or file shares, you can use the [SharePoint Migration Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepointmigration/migrate-to-sharepoint-online).

Video is a great way to communicate to the people in your organization. Videos ranging from executive briefings to individual users creating tutorials or sharing ideas can lead to greater engagement of intranet users. An important component of this in Microsoft 365 is [Microsoft Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream). You can use Stream to deliver live and on-demand meetings, events, and training. If you have existing video content that you want to make available on your new intranet site, [upload it to Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/portal-upload-video) as part of your content migration process.

*Start by -* Understanding the full scope of content that might need to be migrated and then define the criteria used to target content that should be migrated, should be edited and then migrated, and should be retired. 

*You'll know your done when -* You've got the minimum amount of content necessary to create and launch an effective SharePoint site.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Determine your permissions and sharing strategy

SharePoint [permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/modern-experience-sharing-permissions) are managed through a set of roles within a site - owners, members, and visitors. Depending on the type of site, there may be additional permission and sharing options available like using Office 365 groups. 

*Start by -* Determining who needs access, who should not have access, and how you will grant access for requests.

*You'll know your done when -* All site owners and user have access to the content they need, while securing confidential content when appropriate.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Design the intranet portal page

The [main intranet portal for your organization](home-site.md) is a big part of your new SharePoint intranet. You can create this page at any time during your intranet development project. With a modern portal page, you can still point to your legacy intranet sites. If you have an existing communication site that you want to use as your main portal page, you can [move it to the root site](modern-root-site.md#replace-your-root-site).

The [mega menu](https://support.office.com/article/d6768545-2391-4c66-9a8c-a85eb76b4cf5), [news web part](https://support.office.com/article/C2DCEE50-F5D7-434B-8CB9-A7FEEFD9F165), and [Yammer feeds](https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/yammer-landing-page) can all be used to make your main portal page an engaging and productive destination for your users. Read [Guided walkthrough: Creating an Enterprise Landing site for your organization](https://support.office.com/article/9c1842c3-543e-4891-85d3-0eaf680e242d) for an end-to-end look at creating this page.

*Start by -* Considering the goals from the perspective of your IT department, your organization's communications team, and end users of the experience. Design the portal page with simplicity and scalability in mind.

*You'll know your done when -* You've created a launch plan for redirecting from your current portal page to the new page and have shared this plan with all stakeholders and end-users.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Design your business-specific intranet site

As you start designing the intranet sites for your group, consider surveying your users to better understand their needs and how they currently interact with your content. You can use [Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/forms-pro)
to create custom surveys and questionnaires.

We recommend developing your intranet pages using [communication sites](https://support.office.com/article/94A33429-E580-45C3-A090-5512A8070732). With communication sites, you can share news, reports, statuses, and other information through a variety of templates and web parts. For an end-to-end look at setting up a communication site, see [Guided walkthrough: Creating a communication site for your organization](https://support.office.com/article/d9aaecc7-e2df-43a7-acc2-bd37f1fe7cfe). Learn more about [how to plan your sites](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/plan-your-sharepoint-site-get-started-35d9adfe-d5cc-462f-a63a-bae7f2529182?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US). 

You can use the [news web part](https://support.office.com/article/C2DCEE50-F5D7-434B-8CB9-A7FEEFD9F165) to post important or interesting stories, announcements, people news, status updates, and more that can include graphics and rich formatting. Within the news web part, you can set up [audience targeting](https://support.office.com/article/68113d1b-be99-4d4c-a61c-73b087f48a81) to prioritize specific content for specific audiences. For an end-to-end look at using news in SharePoint, see [Guided walkthrough: setting up news for your organization](https://support.office.com/article/95a90834-96a2-463c-b741-31c4d2230706).

You can [change the look of your site](https://support.office.com/article/06bbadc3-6b04-4a60-9d14-894f6a170818) to match your organization's branding requirements.

Consider setting up an [approval flow](https://support.office.com/article/a8b2e689-d4a1-4639-8028-333c0ece30d9) for changes to your site. This can help you maintain standards within your group as people update pages with the latest information.

*Start by -* Prioritizing business objectives, and then decide the type of sites and web parts that will be needed initially.

*You'll know your done when -* Business and site owners have dedicated areas in SharePoint that can been owned and maintained with little over sight. 


### Content creators

Content creators are the people who will be responsible for the day-to-day management and creation of content. Content creators can take on many responsibilities such as creating and publishing organizational news, subject matter experts for special projects and initiatives and thought leaders. Content creators should get familiar with [SharePoint design fundamentals](https://support.office.com/article/Plan-your-SharePoint-site-21761aac-f7f7-4499-b0ca-cf283477c32f). 

Keep in mind these key success factors as you create and manage content for your intranet:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Have an executive sponsor
> * Design for simplicity and longevity 
> * Ask for feedback from users during all stages of the design process
> * Work with champions and thought leaders in the organization
> * Establish KPIs and regularly communicate them from project start to finish

#### Inform and engage

Collect and manage content using SharePoint [lists](https://support.office.com/article/video-introduction-to-lists-1d0b0500-baa0-4344-bdcb-7e1aea84ad11) and [libraries](https://support.office.com/article/video-introduction-to-libraries-1317b9aa-ca8f-4b5f-84aa-482c3c35dd65) just like you might collect information in Excel. Lists enable you and your teams to gather, track, and share information within SharePoint libraries. Easily add, reorder, sort, filter, and create custom views of libraries using the [Document library web part](https://support.office.com/article/use-the-document-library-web-part-a9dfecc3-2050-4528-9f00-2c5afc5731b0). Improve the display of lists with column and list view formatting using the [List web part](https://support.office.com/article/use-the-list-web-part-ef0a1b80-f8b3-443d-b04a-1e76c70b5537). Dynamically display content from a document library, a site, a site collection, or all sites using the [Highlighted content web part](https://support.office.com/article/use-the-highlighted-content-web-part-e34199b0-ff1a-47fb-8f4d-dbcaed329efd). 

Create and curate news relevant to your audience using the [News web part](https://support.office.com/article/use-the-news-web-part-on-a-sharepoint-page-c2dcee50-f5d7-434b-8cb9-a7feefd9f165). Quickly create eye-catching posts like announcements, people news, status updates, and more that can include graphics and rich formatting. The News web part allows you to specify the source for automatic news posts and the order you want them to appear on your page.

Customize the way your users view content and news by using [audience targeting](https://support.office.com/article/target-files-news-and-pages-to-specific-audiences-33d84cb6-14ed-4e53-a426-74c38ea32293). Audience targeting enables specific content to be prioritized to specific audiences on the SharePoint start page, news on the mobile app, and in News web part when audience targeting is enabled. 

*Start by:* Organizing content into lists, libraries, and news. Then, connect specific content to specific audiences using audience targeting.

*You'll know your done when:* You can confirm users have access to the right information at the right time by using [site usage and analytics](https://support.office.com/article/view-usage-data-for-your-sharepoint-site-2fa8ddc2-c4b3-4268-8d26-a772dc55779e) and asking users for feedback. 

#### Connect and collaborate

With Office and OneDrive or SharePoint, multiple people can [collaborate](https://support.office.com/article/Collaborate-in-SharePoint-Online-0c5c3345-0a61-4532-971c-5a1e0970fde3) on a Word document, Excel spreadsheet, or PowerPoint presentation. When everyone is working at the same time, that's called co-authoring. [Co-authoring](https://support.office.com/article/document-collaboration-and-co-authoring-ee1509b4-1f6e-401e-b04a-782d26f564a4?ocmsassetID=HA102772333&CTT=1&CorrelationId=b620f8ff-d4a2-437a-ba02-3f40546bd326&ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) is two or more authors work on different parts of a document at the same time. While one author works on his section of the document, another author can work on hers, without either interrupting the other's work. Co-authoring removes barriers to server-based document collaboration and helps organizations to reduce the overhead associated with traditional document sharing through attachments.

Enable users to work on any device. When users keep files on their local device or on a network share, they're out of luck when they don't have the device with them or don't have a connection to your network. If something happens to a user's device, the data might not be recoverable. If a user's device is upgraded, local data must be migrated. By storing files OneDrive, users can access them from all their devices, such as their phone and their home computer (depending on what you allow). They can even access files in a browser from other devices they trust. [Get the SharePoint mobile app](https://products.office.com/sharepoint/mobile-app?rtc=1).

*Start by:* Working with your site collection administrator, confirm which Microsoft 365 applications your organization has access to in order to understand which products can be co-authored. 

*You'll know your done when:* You can confirm users are able to accomplish more in their workday by using your site.

#### Build culture and community

Help work groups connect and engage across your organization using Yammer. Use Yammer to discuss ideas, share updates, and network with others. Yammer Conversations allow users to participate in online conversations without leaving your SharePoint page. Yammer Highlights provides a quick overview of active conversations and a targeted portal to specific groups or conversations in Yammer. [Learn more about the Yammer Highlights and Yammer Conversations web parts](https://support.office.com/article/use-a-yammer-web-part-in-sharepoint-online-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da). 
 
Sometimes content needs to be delivered through video - like when organization-wide announcements are made or when senior leaders host a live event. [Microsoft Stream](https://support.office.com/article/Microsoft-Stream-Your-company-s-video-portal-c3240bd5-5f80-4fd0-a37d-7a3275605f3a) is your company's own video site. Use the [Stream web part](https://support.office.com/article/Use-the-Stream-web-part-B97FA87C-1337-4271-A059-17F0D2B26E8B) on your site to display video content.

*Start by:* Finding news, announcements, and events to amplify throughout your organization.

*You'll know your done when:* You are regularly promoting news and events that start conversations and engage and connect wide audiences. 


## Section 2: SharePoint design fundamentals and building blocks
