### Summary of roles and key tasks

#### Company intranet owner

The company intranet owner works with business owners and IT to prioritize the intranet projects in your portfolio for the greatest business benefit in the shortest time.

Start by getting inspired with the [SharePoint lookbook](https://aka.ms/sharepointlookbook). The lookbook provides examples of intranet pages that you can build in SharePoint and will give you an idea of the possibilities. Keep these in mind as you proceed through the planning and implementation process.

Next, start to [plan your intelligent SharePoint intranet](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/plan-intranet) by reviewing your existing intranet and determining which project to start with for your best return on investment. As you prioritize your intranet projects, consider how to get the [best performance and scalability](https://docs.microsoft.com/SharePoint/portal-health) from the portals that you build. If your existing intranet is using SharePoint server, consider how [migrating your content to SharePoint Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepointmigration/migrate-to-sharepoint-online) fits into your overall plan.

Then, choose a project to start with and meet with the business owners in that area of your organization to plan the project.

Keep in mind these key success factors as you plan and implement your intranet:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Have an executive sponsor and find intranet champions
> * Design for simplicity and longevity 
> * Ask for feedback from users during all stages of the design process
> * Establish KPIs and regularly communicate them from project start to finish

**Key tasks:**
#### Organize your intranet

A critical part of your SharePoint intranet is your site architecture. By using a series of [communication sites](https://support.office.com/article/94A33429-E580-45C3-A090-5512A8070732) and [hub sites](planning-hub-sites.md), you can create an intuitive intranet with common navigation across sites and an easy-to-manage permissions structure. See [Planning navigation for the modern SharePoint experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/plan-navigation-modern-experience) for a detailed look at site navigation in SharePoint.

#### Brand your intranet

Branding is an important part of your intranet. With SharePoint, you can [add branding your SharePoint site](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/branding-sharepoint-online-sites-modern-experience), and also [customize the Office 365 theme for your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/setup/customize-your-organization-theme).

*You'll know your done when:*


#### IT/Admins

- Implement the needed platform integration steps - such as with databases or line of business applications - needed by your business owners for their intranet portals.
- Training business owners, content creators, and end users

- High level summary of role
- Key success factors relevant to specific role
- Entry points to role specific content

**Key tasks:**
#### Train your content creators

[Microsoft 365 learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/)

These references can help your content creators manage updates to the site.

- [Create a document library in SharePoint](https://support.office.com/client/306728fe-0325-4b28-b60d-f902e1d75939)

*Start by:*
*You'll know your done when:*


#### Business owners and site owners

As a business owner, you may be responsible for intranet content for a particular area of your organization such as HR or facilities. With SharePoint, you can easily create and maintain the content that you need. Look over the [SharePoint lookbook](https://aka.ms/sharepointlookbook) for some ideas before you start your intranet planning.

Keep in mind these key success factors as you plan and implement your intranet:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Have an executive sponsor
> * Design for simplicity and longevity 
> * Ask for feedback from users during all stages of the design process
> * Work with champions and thought leaders in the organization
> * Establish KPIs and regularly communicate them from project start to finish

**Key tasks:**
#### Migrate your data

One of the largest tasks in creating a new intranet site is migrating your existing data to SharePoint. We highly recommend doing a content audit to see what's being used, what's up-to-date, and what's no longer needed and can be unpublished. Oftentimes, organizations can achieve higher user satisfaction and easier maintenance by removing content that's no longer needed. This also reduces the amount of content that you need to migrate to SharePoint.

If you're migrating files from SharePoint Server on-premises or file shares, you can use the [SharePoint Migration Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepointmigration/migrate-to-sharepoint-online).

Video is a great way to communicate to the people in your organization. Videos ranging from executive briefings to individual users creating tutorials or sharing ideas can lead to greater engagement of intranet users. An important component of this in Microsoft 365 is [Microsoft Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream). You can use Stream to deliver live and on-demand meetings, events, and training. If you have existing video content that you want to make available on your new intranet site, [upload it to Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/portal-upload-video) as part of your content migration process.

*You'll know your done when:*

#### Design the intranet portal page

The [main intranet portal for your organization](home-site.md) is a big part of your new SharePoint intranet. You can create this page at any time during your intranet development project. With a modern portal page, you can still point to your legacy intranet sites. If you have an existing communication site that you want to use as your main portal page, you can [move it to the root site](modern-root-site.md#replace-your-root-site).

The [mega menu](https://support.office.com/article/d6768545-2391-4c66-9a8c-a85eb76b4cf5), [news web part](https://support.office.com/article/C2DCEE50-F5D7-434B-8CB9-A7FEEFD9F165), and [Yammer feeds](https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/yammer-landing-page) can all be used to make your main portal page an engaging and productive destination for your users. Read [Guided walkthrough: Creating an Enterprise Landing site for your organization](https://support.office.com/article/9c1842c3-543e-4891-85d3-0eaf680e242d) for an end-to-end look at creating this page.

#### Design your business-specific intranet site

As you start designing the intranet sites for your group, consider surveying your users to better understand their needs and how they currently interact with your content. You can use [Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/forms-pro)
to create custom surveys and questionnaires.

We recommend developing your intranet pages using [communication sites](https://support.office.com/article/94A33429-E580-45C3-A090-5512A8070732). With communication sites, you can share news, reports, statuses, and other information through a variety of templates and web parts. For an end-to-end look at setting up a communication site, see [Guided walkthrough: Creating a communication site for your organization](https://support.office.com/article/d9aaecc7-e2df-43a7-acc2-bd37f1fe7cfe).

You can use the [news web part](https://support.office.com/article/C2DCEE50-F5D7-434B-8CB9-A7FEEFD9F165) to post important or interesting stories, announcements, people news, status updates, and more that can include graphics and rich formatting. Within the news web part, you can set up [audience targeting](https://support.office.com/article/68113d1b-be99-4d4c-a61c-73b087f48a81) to prioritize specific content for specific audiences. For an end-to-end look at using news in SharePoint, see [Guided walkthrough: setting up news for your organization](https://support.office.com/article/95a90834-96a2-463c-b741-31c4d2230706).

You can [change the look of your site](https://support.office.com/article/06bbadc3-6b04-4a60-9d14-894f6a170818) to match your organization's branding requirements.

Consider setting up an [approval flow](https://support.office.com/article/a8b2e689-d4a1-4639-8028-333c0ece30d9) for changes to your site. This can help you maintain standards within your group as people update pages with the latest information.

### Content creators

Content creators are the people who will be responsible for the day-to-day management and creation of content. Content creators can take on many responsibilities such as creating and publishing organizational news, subject matter experts for special projects and initiatives and thought leaders.

Content creators should get familiar with SharePoint design fundamentals and building blocks. 

Keep in mind these key success factors as you create and manage content for your intranet:

- Develop a content strategy and publishing schedule
- Ask for feedback and allow for comments and social interaction
- Schedule content audits as needed to ensure content is relevant

**Key tasks:**

- Launch and manage sites
- Create and manage content
- Inform and engage
- Build culture and community
- Connect and collaborate
