# Launching a successful SharePoint portal 

## The importance of planning

Having a successful launch of a portal is the goal. Your portal needs to withstand real world usage scenarios and you want to identify impacts to internal systems and processes, making sure the changes donâ€™t break anything. A successful portal launches, preparing for its continued reliability and performance, are critical for your business.

By taking the time to plan and using Microsoft best practices will help you have launch experience you want.

### What is a Portal?

A portal is typically the key site for communicating out content for your company or division with greater than 10,000 visitor members on the site.  It may be a hub site, but also a Home site or root site.

A portal often utilizes features such as: 

- Rollups across sites 
- Organization News 
- Audience targeting 
- Megamenu navigation 
- Footer 
- Branding 
- Events 
 
### What is NOT a Portal 

It's also important to recognize what isn't a "portal".  The high collaboration site you use for team work is not considered a portal.
