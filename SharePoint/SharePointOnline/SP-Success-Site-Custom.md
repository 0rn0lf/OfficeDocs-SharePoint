# Customizing a SharePoint Success Site

## Overview 
The following sections of the SharePoint Success Site (SharePoint Success Site) should be customized to meet your requirements, prior to rolling out to end users: 

- SharePoint site template 

•	Up-to-date content feed
•	Custom playlists
•	Boilerplate SharePoint usage policies
•	Success stories
•	Portal team
•	Champions community

## SharePoint Site Template

There are several different ways you can make the SharePoint Success Site template your own: 
•	Branding 
•	Customizing the hero graphic
•	Adding web parts to your site
•	Change the logo 
•	Customize the navigation 
•	Customize the page layout

## Up-to-Date Content Feed
<to be update>
The Create your site playlist content may need to be adjusted to align with the site provisioning method you have chosen for your SharePoint implementation. The Create your site playlist content is based on the default self-service site provisioning experience where end users can create their own SharePoint site without IT intervention. If your organization prevents users from creating their own sites or includes any other modifications to the site provisioning experience (e.g., create a site form that must be completed by users), edit the Create your site playlist accordingly. 
To learn more about how to manage site creation in SharePoint Online refer to this article.

## Success Stories
The success stories section is a gallery for organizations to populate with internal SharePoint Online success stories that inspire others in the organization about what is possible with SharePoint.

Add success stories to your portal
If available, add existing SharePoint success stories to your portal. If success stories are not currently available, consider working with interested departments in building high priority and easy to implement SharePoint sites and/or solutions. Delivering these “early wins” will help inspire others in the organization on the possibilities for using SharePoint themselves to achieve important business outcomes. See adoption section for more information.  
Create form to solicit success stories
The purpose of the “Success Stories” section is to enable peers to learn from one another on how they can use SharePoint to create sites that help them achieve their objectives. End users will be able to learn from the successes and lessons from peers who have implemented SharePoint solutions. 
To help solicit SharePoint success stories from your end users (for posting on the portal), build a success story submission form utilizing Microsoft Forms – http://forms.office.com. 
  
1.	Create a submission form at https://forms.office.com

  

  

To gather the right information about each SharePoint Online story, consider including the following questions: 

•	Name of solution
•	Project team members
•	Who is the sponsor of the project?
•	What Office 365 technologies (e.g., SharePoint, Yammer, Stream, Flow) were used as part of the solution?
•	What were the reasons for building the SharePoint site/solution?
•	Provide a description of the solution
•	What impact or results has the SharePoint site/solution generated?
•	What best practices for planning and implementing your solution would you recommend to other who are building their own SharePoint site/solution? 
See here for more information about how to use Microsoft Forms.
2.	Click share and copy the link to the form  
 


3.	Insert the link into your portal 

 

## Portal team
If your organization has a portal/Intranet team that will be supporting site owners, consider adding the team members on the SharePoint Success Site homepage using the people web part. If you will not have a dedicated team supporting site owners, remove the current people web part. 

## Champions Community
To help build, grow, and sustain your SharePoint Online adoption and support site owners, we recommend building a portal champions community on Yammer. Portal champions can answer SharePoint related questions posted in the Yammer group and encourage site owners to share their successes and best practices. 
See the champions program guide here for more information on how to build a successful champions program. 
To increase visibility and engagement within your portal champions community, integrate the Yammer group hosting your community into the SharePoint Success Site using the Yammer web part. 
  
To integrate a Yammer feed into the portal, see here for instructions.
