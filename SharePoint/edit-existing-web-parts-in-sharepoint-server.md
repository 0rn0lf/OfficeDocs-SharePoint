See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of SharePoint an article applies to.** * **Applies to:** SharePoint Foundation 2013, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016*  * **Topic Last Modified:** 2017-05-30* **Summary:Â ** How to edit SharePoint Server 2016 web parts and web part properties.SharePoint Server 2016 web parts can be edited to change their view, appearance, layout and other properties. Editing a SharePoint Server 2016 web part can be fast and simple, and done right on the page where the web part is found. The procedure for editing a SharePoint Server 2016 web part is the same for all web parts, but the editable properties for each may be different. In all cases you'll be using your Web browser and be working on each SharePoint Server 2016 web part individually. This topic will cover this common procedure and describe the overall process for SharePoint Server 2016 web part editing. Specific properties for each web part will not be covered as help for these is available from right inside your browser on your SharePoint Server 2016 site page. 
## Editing a SharePoint Server 2016 web part

The procedure for editing a SharePoint Server 2016 web part involves editing the page the web part is on, and then editing the web part itself. This procedure is the same for all web parts and can be used on any web parts on the page you edit. Keep in mind, since that this procedure describes how to edit any web part, it covers only the procedure to take you to the step where the web part is ready to edit and its properties are available for editing, it will not describe any of the properties available for editing for any specific web part. Specific web part property information is available for many web parts individually on the page you're editing using the SharePoint Server 2016 online help found right next to your username and the settings **Gear** icon on every SharePoint Server 2016 page in the form of a **Question Mark** icon. **How to edit web parts**
1. Confirm that you have administrative rights to the page and all web parts you will edit.
    
  
2. Browse to the SharePoint Server 2016 site that contains the web part or parts you will edit. 
    
  
3. On the SharePoint Ribbon, select the **Page** tab.
    
  
4. Select **Edit**.
    
    > [!NOTE:]
      
5. Move your mouse over the upper right corner of the web part you will edit. 
    
    > [!NOTE:]
      
6. The drop-down arrow allows similar choices with the addition of the **Export** option. Export allows you to save the entire selected Web-Part in the **.webpart** file format for import and use on another page or SharePoint Server 2016 site.
    
  
7. The editable properties for the selected web part are available by selecting **Web Part Properties**, from the **Web Part** tab in the Ribbon, or **Edit Web Part** from the drop-down arrow.
    
  
8. That's it. You're editing a SharePoint Server 2016 web part. 
    
  
9. When you've completed editing, to save your work and return to the normal page view, select the **Page** tab in the Ribbon, and then click **Save**. This will save your work and exit the edit mode and return you to your normal page view.
