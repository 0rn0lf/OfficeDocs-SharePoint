# Add the Yammer Embed widget to a SharePoint page

 **Summary:** Learn how to use the Yammer Embed widget to include Yammer feeds on SharePoint pages. 
  
The Yammer Embed widget is a thin layer of JavaScript that renders HTML, which you can insert into a SharePoint Server 2013 page. The widget displays one of several types of Yammer feeds directly from Yammer, and it also handles authentication. If a user hasn't yet logged on to Yammer, the widget provides a user interface to do this.
  
To use Yammer Embed, just add the JavaScript snippet for the feed to your SharePoint site. You can use the [Yammer Embed configuration tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=507500), as depicted in the screenshot below, to select the feed type and settings that you want to use, and then get a JavaScript snippet that contains those settings to embed into a SharePoint page.

When you use this JavaScript snippet on a SharePoint page, you can add it to a Script Editor Web Part and place it anywhere on the page. The widget shows users the latest messages based on how Yammer Embed is configured.
