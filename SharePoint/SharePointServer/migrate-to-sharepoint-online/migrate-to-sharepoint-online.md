# Migrate to SharePoint Online

Moving to SharePoint Online?
  
There are different options available to migrate content to SharePoint Online, depending on the size and quantity of files you need to move. 
  
## What is SharePoint Online?

SharePoint Online is a cloud based collaboration platform that lets you and your organization store, organize, and share data and easily communicate with each other. 
  
## Planning your move to SharePoint online

The strategy you select to move your data depends on the amount of data and the size. 
  
## Make an assessment of your content

Before deciding on a migration strategy, perform an analysis of your current environment. What data do you want or need to move? Where is the content currently stored? should focus on those SharePoint workloads and content that you plan to move to SharePoint Online.
  
As an outcome of the analysis you should have a clear understanding on the content and the customizations you have in your On-Premises environment.
  
You should then create a content and customization roadmap that covers what content and customizations that will be moved to SharePoint Online and how they will be moved.
  
For each customization you will need to decide if you want to provide that functionality in your SharePoint Online environment. As the next step you will need to validate if the customizations can be implemented as sandboxed solutions.
