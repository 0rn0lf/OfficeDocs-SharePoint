# Information management and governance in SharePoint

 **Summary:** Learn how to plan effective information architecture to ensure that your SharePoint solution meets your business needs. 
  
How will you govern the information in your organization, such as documents, lists, websites, and webpages? How do you maximize the information's usability and manageability? Who has access to what information? How are you making information available internally and externally, and to whom?
  
## What is information architecture?
<a name="InformationArchitecture"> </a>

Information architecture determines how the information in that site or solution—its webpages, documents, lists, and data—is organized and presented to the site's users. Information architecture is often recorded as a hierarchical list of content, search keywords, data types, and other concepts.
  
Assess your organization's information architecture to make it as efficient as possible: A comprehensive assessment of your organization's information architecture can help you identify efficiencies, such as the following:
  
- Use metadata to make it easier to search for and compare related data or content.
    
- Manage versions and records to ensure that you can tell which is the authoritative version of a document.
    
- Catalog and store information properly so decision-makers can find and rely on the right data.
    
- Design navigation and present information so that users can find important sites and information.
    
- Integrate your information architecture with your environment's search strategy, so your users can find the right information. Information architecture includes the wireframe and site map, search and navigation, managed metadata tags, and content types.
    
- Define a publishing strategy: distribute authoring tasks and use cross-site publishing to control the design of the site and display of the content.
    
Good information architecture supports the following goals:
  
- **Manageable** Can the IT team effectively implement and manage the information? 
    
- **Meets requirements** Does the information architecture meet regulatory requirements, privacy needs, and security goals? 
    
- **Increases business effectiveness** Does the architecture add to your organization's effectiveness? 
    
Questions to ask when you design a site or solution:

## Information access
<a name="InformationAccess"> </a>

Be sure to consider access to content when you design your solution and sites. This overlaps with IT governance as you consider your entire environment. Ask these questions:
  
**Information management: permissions and audiences**

|**Question**|**More information**|
|:-----|:-----|
|How do I structure permission in a site?  <br/> |[Overview of site permissions in SharePoint 2013](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ded359db-05ce-4ebc-945c-caf56cea29fe.aspx) <br/> |
|How do I target content to a specific audience?  <br/> |[Audience and content targeting planning (SharePoint Server 2010)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=330811) <br/> |
|Should I use Information Rights Management (IRM) to protect content?  <br/> |[Plan Information Rights Management (SharePoint Server 2010)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=330814) <br/> |
   
**IT governance: access**

|**Question**|**More information**|
|:-----|:-----|
|How do I make this content available to external users?  <br/> |[SharePoint Server design samples: Corporate portal and extranet sites](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/1cffb278-6497-46fc-abd0-3dd652064c89%28Office.14%29.aspx) <br/> |
|How do I make sure that only people who need access have it?  <br/> |[Security and permissions (SharePoint 2013)](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/119a2902-0f65-4086-9192-ac73b32149d8%28Office.14%29.aspx) <br/> |
   
## Information management tools
<a name="Tools"> </a>

Govern your information by using tools for information management, including:
  
|**Tool**|**More information**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Use workflows and approvals for Document Centers and site pages—wherever official documentation is stored.  <br/> |[Plan content types and workflows in SharePoint 2013](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/63bb092a-00fe-45ff-a4b8-d8be998d1a3c%28Office.14%29.aspx) <br/> |
|Use approval for published websites to control pages.  <br/> |[Plan for Internet, intranet, and extranet publishing sites in SharePoint Server](../administration/plan-for-internet-intranet-and-extranet-publishing-sites.md) and [Plan content types and workflows in SharePoint 2013](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/63bb092a-00fe-45ff-a4b8-d8be998d1a3c%28Office.14%29.aspx) <br/> |
|Use version history and version control to maintain a history and master document.  <br/> |[Plan document versioning, content approval, and check-out controls in SharePoint 2013](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/428b488e-2807-4ef0-b942-91cb09d8921c%28Office.14%29.aspx) <br/> |
|Use content types with auditing and expiration for document libraries to manage document life cycle.  <br/> |[Plan document management in SharePoint Server](document-management-planning.md) <br/> |
|Manage libraries by using the Content Organizer.  <br/> |[Configure the Content Organizer to route documents](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=330815) <br/> |
|Use site policies to manage site collection life cycles.  <br/> |[Overview of site policies in SharePoint Server](../sites/site-policy-overview.md) <br/> |
|Use Information Rights Management and auditing to secure and audit important corporate assets and any sites that contain sensitive information.  <br/> |[Apply Information Rights Management to a list or library](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=330818) and [Configure audit settings for a site collection](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=330817) <br/> |
   
Determine the rules or policies that you need for the following types of items: pages, lists, [documents](document-management-planning.md), [records](records-management-in-sharepoint-server.md), rich [assets](../sites/managing-digital-assets-overview.md), blogs and wikis, [feeds](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/9f928134-dec3-4750-8b99-1191716334b4%28Office.14%29.aspx), anonymous comments, anonymous access, [terms and term sets](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/7f8f6beb-aaa6-4277-b522-d28a5b746087%28Office.14%29.aspx), and external data ([Business Connectivity Services](../administration/business-connectivity-services-overview.md)).
  
As a good information management practice, consider the balance among the following factors:
  
- **Availability** Content needs to be available when users need it and where they can get to it. 
    
- **Access** Consider who has access to the content. If it should be secure, is it? 
    
- **Redundancy** Shared copies reduce redundancy and provide one version of a document. 
    
Consider your priorities for different content by thinking through questions like these:
  
- Which of these factors is the highest priority for each type of content?
    
- Is availability more important than access?
    
- Is access more important than redundancy?
    
- What would make it so difficult for users that they would be tempted to use a different solution?
    
- What trade-offs are possible or desirable?
