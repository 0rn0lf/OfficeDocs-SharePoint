# Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol support in SharePoint Server 2016
 **We are in the process of combining the SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of SharePoint an article applies to.** * **Topic Last Modified:** 2016-11-14* **Summary:** This article describes the versions of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol that SharePoint Server 2016 supports.
## Supported TLS Protocols

SharePoint Server 2016 supports the following versions of the TLS protocol:
- TLS 1.2
    
  
- TLS 1.1
    
  
- TLS 1.0
    
  
For information about how to enable TLS support, see  [Enable TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 support in SharePoint Server 2016](html/enable-tls-1-1-and-tls-1-2-support-in-sharepoint-server-2016.md)
## Not fully supported SSL Protocols

SharePoint Server 2016 does not fully support SSL 3.0. **This is because SharePoint disables SSL 3.0 connection encryption by default for some, but not all features.**
