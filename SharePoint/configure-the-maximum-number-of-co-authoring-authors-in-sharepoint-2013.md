## Configure the maximum number of co-authoring authors for SharePoint 2013

You can limit the number of users who can co-author a document at the same time by setting the CoauthoringMaxAuthors property. This property only applies to Word 2010, Word 2013, Word Web App, PowerPoint 2010, PowerPoint 2013 and PowerPoint Web App documents. There is no upper limit to the number of users who can co-author OneNote notebooks. **To configure the maximum number of co-authoring users for Word documents and PowerPoint presentations by using Windows PowerShell (save as script and run script)**
1. Verify that you have the following memberships:
    
  - **securityadmin** fixed server role on the SQL Server instance.
    
  
  - **db_owner** fixed database role on all databases that are to be updated.
    
  
  - Administrators group on the server on which you are running PowerShell cmdlets.
    
  

    An administrator can use the **Add-SPShellAdmin** cmdlet to grant permissions to use SharePoint Server 2013 cmdlets.
    
    > [!NOTE:]
      
2. Paste the following code into a text editor, such as Notepad:
    
  ```
  
$siteurl = "<ServerName> "
$mysite=new-object Microsoft.SharePoint.SPSite($siteurl)
$mysite.WebApplication.WebService.CoauthoringMaxAuthors = <MaxAuthors> 
$mysite.WebApplication.WebService.Update()
  ```

3. Replace:
    
  -  *<ServerName>*  with the name of the server.
    
  
  -  *<MaxAuthors>*  with the maximum number of authors to allow.
    
  
4. Save the file and add the .ps1 extension, such as SuggestedNameOfFile.ps1.
    
    > [!NOTE:]
