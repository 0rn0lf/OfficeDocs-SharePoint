# Accessibility guidelines in SharePoint Server 2016
 **We are in the process of combining the SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of SharePoint an article applies to.** * **Applies to:** SharePoint Server 2016*  * **Topic Last Modified:** 2017-07-14* **Summary:** Access and learn about the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Conformance Statement and Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) for SharePoint Server 2016 and SharePoint Server 2013.SharePoint Server supports the accessibility features of common browsers that help IT Pros administer deployments and access sites. For more information about supported features, see  [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).Administrators and other users who have administrative responsibilities typically use the SharePoint Central Administration website and the SharePoint 2016 Management Shell to manage deployments. The mouse and keyboard are typical devices that administrators use to interact with Central Administration.Because SharePoint Server runs as web sites in Internet Information Services (IIS), administrators and users depend on the accessibility features that browsers provide. SharePoint Server supports the accessibility features of supported browsers. For more information, see  [Plan browser support in SharePoint Server 2016](html/plan-browser-support-in-sharepoint-server-2016.md).Users who don't use a mouse can use a keyboard to navigate the user interface and complete actions. The ability to use the keyboard in this way is a result of support for keyboard interactions that a browser provides. Users who have devices that support touch can also use gestures to complete operations. For more information, see  [Touch](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742468.aspx).
