The Yammerapp for SharePoint lets you embed Yammer feeds into on-premises SharePoint Server 2013 sites to make them more social and engaging. Before you can do that, you have to both remove the Newsfeed Web Parts from My Sites and team sites and hide the user interface controls that provide the social features youâ€™ll replace with Yammer. Next, you add the Yammer app to the App Catalog and install and set up the Yammer feed on your sites. This article takes you through the steps that are required to do the second part: add the Yammer app to the App Catalog and install and set up the Yammer feed on your team sites. For information about how to remove the Newsfeed Web Parts from My Sites and team sites and hide the user interface controls, see  [Hide SharePoint Server 2013 social features](html/hide-sharepoint-server-2013-social-features.md).Before you get started, make sure you have configured one of the  [Yammer social scenarios](html/social-scenarios-with-yammer-and-sharepoint-server-2013.md) in SharePoint Server 2013.
