# Video demo of Zero Downtime Patching in SharePoint Server 2016
 **We are in the process of combining the SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of SharePoint an article applies to.** * **Applies to:** SharePoint Server 2016*  * **Topic Last Modified:** 2017-05-23* **Summary:** Take a SharePoint tutorial that can help you learn how to patch a server in a SharePoint Server 2016 farm by using Zero Downtime Patching.
## Overview

One of the new features in SharePoint Server 2016 is Zero Downtime patching.Zero Downtime patching doesnâ€™t demand any server downtime while patching a SharePoint Server 2016 farm, but does require that your farm be set up in a Highly Available (HA) configuration (so that SharePoint roles are hosted on more than one server). That way, patching can be done in batches where certain of the redundant servers are taken out of load balancing, patched, replaced, and tested for soundness before the other servers follow through the same process.There is a two-step process to patch a server in a SharePoint Server 2016 farm. First, you install the binaries of the patch to each server, this is called the patch phase. Second, after you finish the patch phase, you must complete the update installation by starting the build-to-build upgrade phase.During Zero downtime patching, users can add and edit files and use search just as at any other time, accessing the servers still handled by the load balancer. Likewise, though the database schemas may differ between the patched and unpatched sides of the farm, SharePoint Server 2016 operates in a backward-compatible mode, and its databases are able to properly function, until patching completes.This SharePoint tutorial explains how to patch a SharePoint Server 2016 HA farm from beginning to end, including the installation of the binary files on all servers, and the build-to-build (B2B) upgrade itself.

For reference, here is an overview of the steps, however for further detail on SharePoint patching please watch the video.
1. Remove the Front-end web server (SPWEB01) from the Load balancer.
    
  
2. Patch the front-end web server (SPWEB01) by using the STS &amp; WSS Packages.
    
  
3. Restart the front-end web server (SPWEB01).
    
  
4. Add the front-end web server (SPWEB01) back into the Load balancer.
    
  
5. Remove the front-end web server (SPWEB02) from the Load balancer.
    
  
6. Patch the front-end web server (SPWEB02).
    
  
7. Restart the front-end web server (SPWEB02) computer.
    
  
8. Patch the following Application servers: SPAPP01, SPDCH01, and SPSRCH01 in parallel, and then restart the computers.
    
  
9. Patch the following Application servers: SPAPP02, SPDCH02, and SPSRCH02 in parallel, and then restart the computers.
    
  
10. With the front-end web server (SPWEB02) out of the Load balancer (See step 7), Open the SharePoint 2016 Management Shell, and then run following PSConfig command: PSConfig.exe -cmd upgrade -inplace b2b -wait -cmd applicationcontent -install -cmd installfeatures -cmd secureresources -cmd services -install
    
    > [!NOTE:]
      
11. Once the upgrade is complete, add the front-end web server (SPWEB02) back into the Load balancer. Once the front-end web server (SPWEB02) has been added to the Load balancer, remove the front-end web server (SPWEB01).
    
  
12. On the front-end web server (SPWEB01) computer, run the PSConfig command from step 10.
    
  
13. Add the front-end web server (SPWEB01) back into the Load balancer.
    
  
14. On the Application server (SPAPP01), run the PSConfig command from Step 10.
    
  
15. On the Distributed Cache server (SPDCH01), run the PSConfig command from Step 10.
    
  
16. On the Search server (SPSRCH01), run the PSConfig command from Step10.
    
  
17. Once the upgrade has completed run the same steps (14-16) on 02 series servers (SPAPP02, SPDCH02, SPSRCH02).

During the video the following Microsoft PowerShell script was used to take Servers out of the Azure Service Management Internal Load Balancer.
